# IP269 - Quotes: Bind - Step 3: Sign Documents

## **A) WHY – Vision and Purpose**

The **goal of the Signing Experience** is to:

- Enable policy binding when digital signing is **completed physically** (e.g., in-office, at a dealership, or with an agent) or **remotely** (e.g. at home)
- Ensure **legal and operational compliance.**
- Provide an intuitive and **minimally technical** interface for both users and agents to finalize insurance documentation.

## **B) WHAT – Core Requirements**

If the user attempts to step backwards into the quoting flow, they will be presented a confirmation dialog indicating the policy will need to be re-rated, and any progress made towards binding the policy (uploading images, documents, signatures, etc.) will be purged and must be restarted.

There are two options for signing documents: Signing in Person, or Signing Remotely. This workflow will default to the Signing in Person tab first, and the user an opt to select the Sign Remotely tab if needed.

**Signing In Person**

1. Populate the insured’s full name and initials
2. Generate a representation of the Insured’s signature and initials that will be used to sign the documents
3. Allow the user to adopt the signature before proceeding to signing

**Signing Remotely**

1. Set preferred language, which will dictate the language of the document sent to the insured
2. Send via SMS, or email, and review the contact information pre-filled from the insured’s information captured during quoting
3. Preview the content of the communication in the selected language
