# IP269 - Quotes: Bind - Step 1: Vehicle Photo Upload

## **A) WHY ‚Äì Vision and Purpose**

This step is designed to ensure **proper documentation of each insured vehicle** with photographic evidence. These photos:

- Serve as a **visual condition record** at the time of policy issuance
- Support **underwriting, claims investigation**, and **risk verification**
- Are required for **compliance and audit readiness**

The system must support uploading **six specific photos per vehicle**, guiding users clearly through what is needed, and validating completeness before submission.

## **B) WHAT ‚Äì Core Requirements**

If the user attempts to step backwards into the quoting flow, they will be presented a confirmation dialog indicating the policy will need to be re-rated, and any progress made towards binding the policy (uploading images, documents, signatures, etc.) will be purged and must be restarted.

    - Front
    - Rear
    - Driver Side
    - Passenger Side
    - Odometer

### 2. **Upload Interface**

- Each photo slot is shown clearly with:
    - A label for the required photo type
    - An upload placeholder (camera icon or ‚ÄúUpload Photo‚Äù)
    - Thumbnail preview once uploaded
    - Ability to remove or replace each image

### 3. **Multi-Vehicle Support**
