# IP269-New-Quote-Step-6-Quote-Review - Implementation Approach

## Requirement Understanding

The Quote Review step consolidates all gathered information from previous steps into a comprehensive, editable summary before submission. This step must:

- Display all quote data in organized sections (Primary Insured, Drivers, Vehicles, Coverages, Discounts, Premium)
- Provide inline edit functionality that navigates back to specific steps
- Show premium breakdown including total, fees, down payment, and installment amounts
- Maintain state when editing and returning to review
- Support mobile-responsive collapsible sections
- Validate quote completeness before allowing progression to bind

This is the final checkpoint ensuring accuracy and building user confidence before policy binding.

## Domain Classification
- Primary Domain: ProducerPortal
- Cross-Domain Impact: No
- Complexity Level: Medium

## Pattern Analysis

### Reusable Patterns Identified

**From Infrastructure Codebase:**
- **PolicySummaryService**: Complete summary generation pattern with caching
- **PolicySummaryTabs**: Tab-based organization for policy information
- **CoverageResource**: Coverage formatting and display patterns
- **Premium calculation patterns**: Total premium, fees, and payment breakdowns

**From Global Requirements:**
- **[GR-07 - Reusable Components]**: Component patterns for summary displays
- **[GR-11 - Accessibility]**: WCAG compliance for navigation and review
- **[GR-33 - Data Services & Caching]**: Caching strategies for summary data
- **[GR-18 - Workflow Requirements]**: Navigation patterns between workflow steps

**From Approved ProducerPortal Requirements:**
- **[IP269-Quotes-Search]**: Summary display patterns
- **[IP269-New-Quote-Step-1 through Step-5]**: Data structures from all previous steps

### Domain-Specific Needs
- **Step-based navigation**: Return to specific steps while preserving state
- **Discount display**: Show applied discounts with clear visual indicators
- **Premium breakdown**: Detailed payment schedule for installments
- **Validation summary**: Ensure all required data is complete
- **Edit persistence**: Maintain all data when navigating between steps

## Proposed Implementation

### Simplification Approach
- **Current Complexity**: Multiple data sources, state management across steps, premium calculations, edit navigation
- **Simplified Solution**: 
  - Leverage existing PolicySummaryService patterns for data aggregation
  - Use tab/accordion pattern similar to PolicySummaryTabs
  - Store quote state in session/cache during editing
  - Reuse existing premium calculation logic
  - Simple section-based layout with edit links
- **Trade-offs**: 
  - Gain: Consistent patterns, maintainable code, proven UI components
  - Lose: Advanced inline editing (users navigate to specific steps instead)

### Technical Approach

#### Phase 1: Backend Service Implementation
- [ ] Create `QuoteSummaryService` extending PolicySummaryService patterns
- [ ] Implement data aggregation from all quote steps
- [ ] Add discount calculation and display logic
- [ ] Create premium breakdown calculations
- [ ] Implement session-based state preservation

#### Phase 2: API Endpoints
- [ ] GET `/api/quotes/{id}/summary` - Retrieve complete quote summary
- [ ] GET `/api/quotes/{id}/validate` - Check quote completeness
- [ ] POST `/api/quotes/{id}/navigate` - Handle step navigation with state preservation
- [ ] GET `/api/quotes/{id}/premium-breakdown` - Detailed payment schedule

#### Phase 3: Frontend Components
- [ ] Create `QuoteReviewPage` component with sections:
  - Primary Insured Summary
  - Drivers Summary with tags
  - Vehicles Summary
  - Coverage Details
  - Discounts Applied
  - Premium Breakdown
- [ ] Implement `EditableSection` component with navigation links
- [ ] Create `PremiumSummary` component for payment details
- [ ] Add mobile-responsive accordion layout

#### Phase 4: State Management & Navigation
- [ ] Implement quote state preservation during edits
- [ ] Create navigation service for step transitions
- [ ] Add validation before continuing to bind
- [ ] Ensure data persistence across browser sessions

## Risk Assessment

- **Risk 1**: State loss during navigation → Mitigation: Use session storage and backend persistence
- **Risk 2**: Complex premium calculations → Mitigation: Reuse existing calculation services
- **Risk 3**: Data inconsistency → Mitigation: Single source of truth in backend
- **Risk 4**: Mobile usability → Mitigation: Progressive disclosure with collapsible sections

## Context Preservation

- **Key Decisions**: 
  - Navigate to steps rather than inline editing
  - Reuse PolicySummaryService patterns
  - Session-based state management
  - Section-based organization with clear visual hierarchy
  
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Requires data from all previous steps (1-5)
  - Uses existing summary and calculation services
  - Builds on established UI patterns
  
- **Future Impact**: 
  - Gateway to bind process
  - Foundation for quote comparison features
  - Template for other summary views in the system
