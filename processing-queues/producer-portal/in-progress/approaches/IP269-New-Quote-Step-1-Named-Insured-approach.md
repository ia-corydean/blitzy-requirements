# IP269-New-Quote-Step-1-Named-Insured - Updated Approach

## Cross-Requirement Decisions Incorporated

### âœ… **From Primary Insured Step:**
- **Quote Creation**: Quote entity already created in Step 1 (immediate creation)
- **DCS Integration**: DCS data already populated (name, address, license, ID, DOB)
- **Producer Context**: Producer always attached to quote
- **Data Persistence**: Store and propagate results across models (no caching needed)
- **External Integration**: DCS-first approach established

### ðŸ”„ **Impact on Named Insured Step:**
- This step focuses on **reviewing and enriching** DCS-populated data
- **Read-only fields** come from DCS (already populated in Step 1)
- **Additional fields** require manual entry and validation
- **Data verification** may trigger additional DCS calls if needed

## Questions Requiring Clarification

### Business Logic Questions
1. **Data Verification**: Should additional DCS APIs be used to verify/enrich customer information beyond the initial search?
2. **Field Override Authority**: Can agents modify read-only fields if they identify errors in the DCS data?
3. **Discount Eligibility**: How is discount eligibility determined - business rules engine, external service, or manual selection?
4. **Prior Insurance Validation**: Should prior insurance information be verified against external sources (like ISO or CLUE)?
5. **Notification Preferences**: How do notification preferences integrate with existing communication systems?

### Technical Implementation Questions
1. **Data Enrichment Workflow**: Should additional external data enrichment happen automatically or on-demand?
2. **Field Validation Rules**: What are the specific validation rules for each field (email format, phone format, etc.)?
3. **Error Handling**: How should system handle partial failures in external data enrichment?
4. **Cross-field Validation**: How should dependencies be handled (e.g., email required for paperless discount)?

### Integration Specifics
1. **Additional DCS APIs**: Beyond initial search, are other DCS services needed for verification?
2. **Discount Rule Engine**: Is there an existing discount calculation system to integrate with?
3. **Prior Insurance Sources**: Integration with ISO, CLUE, or other insurance history databases?

## Infrastructure Review

### Existing Codebase Patterns
**Models Available:**
- `Driver` model - DCS data already populated from Step 1
- `User` model - Has address, phone, email fields for contact information
- `CommunicationPreference` model - For notification preferences
- Map tables for relationships (map_user_policy_driver)

**Missing Entities Identified:**
- Gender, marital status reference tables
- Prior insurance entity
- Discount/discount eligibility entities
- Housing information entity

**Service Layer:**
- `UserPreferencesService` - Can be extended for notification preferences
- `VerificationService` - Exists for contact verification
- **New Required**: Data enrichment and validation services

   - Maintain data persistence across workflow steps

2. **Read-Only Field Handling**:
   - DCS-populated fields displayed as read-only
   - Potential override capability (pending clarification)
   - Clear indication of data source (DCS vs. manual)

3. **Additional Data Collection**:
   - New reference entities for gender, marital status, housing
   - Prior insurance tracking entity
   - Discount eligibility management

### Integration Patterns to Apply
1. **DCS Integration** (GR-53): Additional verification calls if needed
2. **Universal Entity Management** (GR-52): For additional external data services
3. **Communication Architecture** (GR-44): For notification preference management

### Workflow Implementation
1. **Data Review**: Display DCS data â†’ Review accuracy â†’ Flag discrepancies
2. **Data Enhancement**: Additional fields â†’ Validation â†’ Cross-field rules
3. **Verification Pipeline**: Contact verification â†’ Discount eligibility â†’ Continue

### Global Requirements Alignment
- **GR-53**: DCS Integration Architecture - for additional verification services
- **GR-52**: Universal Entity Management - for external data enrichment services
- **GR-44**: Communication Architecture - for notification preferences
- **GR-04**: Validation & Data Handling - for field validation rules

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Database Schema Enhancement
1. **New Reference Tables**:
   ```sql
   - gender (code, name, description)
   - marital_status (code, name, description) 
   - housing_type (code, name, description)
   ```

2. **Prior Insurance Entity**:
   ```sql
   - prior_insurance (quote_id, company_name, expiration_date, months_insured)
   ```

3. **Discount Management**:
   ```sql
   - discount_type (code, name, description, requirements)
   - quote_discount_eligibility (quote_id, discount_type_id, eligible, reason)
   ```

### Phase 2: Data Enhancement Service
1. **Data Review Service**:
   - Display DCS-populated data as read-only
   - Flag potential data quality issues
   - Handle override requests (if permitted)

2. **Additional DCS Integration** (if required):
   - Enhanced driver verification calls
   - Address validation services
   - Identity confirmation services

3. **Validation Services**:
   - Enhanced field validation with business rules

   - Real-time validation feedback

### Phase 3: API Development
1. **Data Review Endpoints**:
   ```
   GET /api/v1/quotes/{id}/insured-data - Get populated DCS data
   PUT /api/v1/quotes/{id}/insured-data - Update additional fields
   POST /api/v1/quotes/{id}/verify-data - Trigger additional verification
   ```

2. **Discount and Validation Endpoints**:
   ```
   GET /api/v1/quotes/{id}/eligible-discounts - Get discount eligibility
   POST /api/v1/quotes/{id}/validate-fields - Validate cross-field rules
   POST /api/v1/quotes/{id}/prior-insurance - Add/validate prior insurance
   ```

### Phase 4: Business Rules Implementation
