# IP269-New-Quote-Step-1-Primary-Insured - Implementation Approach

## Requirement Understanding
The Primary Insured step initiates new insurance quotes by collecting and verifying the primary insured's identity. The system must support searching existing records, handling different license types (US and international), validating effective dates, and providing a streamlined experience for both desktop and mobile users. This is the critical first step that establishes the foundation for the entire quote.

## Domain Classification
- Primary Domain: Producer Portal / Quote Management
- Cross-Domain Impact: Yes - Establishes data for entire quote workflow
- Complexity Level: Medium

## Pattern Analysis

### Reusable Patterns Identified
- [GR-69]: Producer Portal Architecture - Quote initiation patterns
- [GR-52]: Universal Entity Management - Driver and name entity reuse
- [GR-41]: Database Standards - Consistent naming and relationships
- [GR-53]: DCS Integration Architecture - Driver verification patterns
- [GR-44]: Communication Architecture - Address validation

### Domain-Specific Needs
- Effective date validation (within 30 days)
- Program availability based on effective date
- License type handling (US vs International)
- Existing record search and matching
- Address modification option for matches
- Quote initialization with primary insured

## Proposed Implementation

### Simplification Approach
- Current Complexity: Multiple license types, search functionality, validation rules
- Simplified Solution: Enhance license table, leverage existing driver/name/address tables
- Trade-offs: Need to add fields to license table for complete functionality

### Technical Approach
1. **Phase 1**: Quote Initialization
   - [ ] Create new quote record
   - [ ] Validate effective date (max 30 days future)
   - [ ] Load available programs for date
   - [ ] Set quote status to "in_progress"

2. **Phase 2**: License Type Handling
   - [ ] Enhance license table with required fields
   - [ ] Implement US License flow (DL number, state)
   - [ ] Implement International flow (name, address)
   - [ ] Country field logic (disabled for US)

3. **Phase 3**: Search Functionality
   - [ ] Search by license number for US licenses
   - [ ] Search by name/address for international
   - [ ] Query existing driver records
   - [ ] Return matching profiles

4. **Phase 4**: Match Handling
   - [ ] Display match results in modal
   - [ ] Handle "Yes - Information Correct"
   - [ ] Handle "No - Not a Match" 
   - [ ] Handle "No - Address Incorrect"
   - [ ] Prefill or allow manual entry

5. **Phase 5**: Data Creation
   - [ ] Create/update driver record
   - [ ] Create/update license record
   - [ ] Create/update name record
   - [ ] Create/update address record
   - [ ] Link to quote via map_quote_driver

6. **Phase 6**: Navigation
   - [ ] Validate all required fields
   - [ ] Save quote progress
   - [ ] Navigate to Step 2 (Drivers)
   - [ ] Maintain quote context

## Risk Assessment
- **Risk 1**: Incomplete license data → Mitigation: Enhance license table first
- **Risk 2**: Match accuracy issues → Mitigation: Fuzzy matching algorithms
- **Risk 3**: Effective date edge cases → Mitigation: Clear validation messages
- **Risk 4**: Performance with large datasets → Mitigation: Indexed searches
- **Risk 5**: Data consistency → Mitigation: Transactional operations

## Context Preservation
- Key Decisions: Enhance license table, reuse existing entities, implement search
- Dependencies: Driver, name, address, license entities
- Future Impact: Foundation for entire quote process, sets data quality standard

## Database Requirements Summary
- **New Tables**: 0 tables need to be created
- **Existing Tables**: 10+ tables will be reused
- **Modified Tables**: 1 existing table needs modifications (license)

## Database Schema Requirements

### Tables to Enhance

#### license (Needs Additional Fields)
Current structure is minimal. Need to add:
```sql
ALTER TABLE license
ADD COLUMN license_number VARCHAR(50) AFTER license_type_id,
ADD COLUMN state_id INT(11) AFTER license_number,
ADD COLUMN country_id INT(11) AFTER state_id,
ADD COLUMN issue_date DATE AFTER country_id,
ADD COLUMN expiration_date DATE AFTER issue_date,
ADD COLUMN is_commercial BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE AFTER expiration_date,
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_license_state FOREIGN KEY (state_id) REFERENCES state(id),
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_license_country FOREIGN KEY (country_id) REFERENCES country(id),
ADD INDEX idx_license_number (license_number),
ADD INDEX idx_state (state_id);
```

### Existing Tables to Use

1. **quote**: Store new quote information
   - Has effective_date, program_id, premium fields
   - Ready for quote creation

2. **driver**: Primary insured information
   - Has name_id, license_id, DOB, gender
   - Supports is_named_insured flag

3. **name**: Personal information
   - Has first_name, last_name, middle_name, suffix
   - Supports both person and business names

4. **address**: Location information
   - Complete address fields
   - Links to driver records

5. **license_type**: License categorization
   - Define US License, International, etc.

6. **program**: Available insurance programs
   - Filter by effective date
   - Contains rating rules

7. **map_quote_driver**: Link quotes to drivers
   - Establishes primary insured relationship

8. **state**: US state reference
   - For license state selection

9. **country**: Country reference
   - For international licenses

10. **gender**: Gender options
    - For driver demographics

### Search Implementation
- Search driver table by license_id
- Join with name for name matching
- Join with address for location matching
- Use indexed fields for performance

## Business Summary for Stakeholders
### What We're Building
A streamlined quote initiation system that captures primary insured information efficiently. The system searches for existing customers to avoid duplicate entry, handles both US and international licenses, validates dates and programs, and provides a smooth experience on all devices. This first step sets up the foundation for accurate quote generation.

### Why It's Needed
Starting quotes with accurate primary insured data is critical for proper rating and compliance. The current manual process is slow and error-prone. This automated system reduces data entry time, improves accuracy through existing record matching, and ensures all quotes start with validated information.

### Expected Outcomes
- Quote initiation time reduced from 10 minutes to 2 minutes
- Duplicate customer records eliminated through matching
- Improved data accuracy with validation rules
- Better user experience with smart field handling
- Foundation for accurate premium calculation

## Technical Summary for Developers
### Key Technical Decisions
- **Architecture Pattern**: Enhance license table, leverage existing entities
- **Search Strategy**: Multi-table search with fuzzy matching
- **License Handling**: Conditional UI based on license type
- **Data Model**: Reuse driver/name/address entities
- **State Management**: Quote-based session management

### Implementation Guidelines
- Extend license model with new fields
- Build search service with multiple strategies
- Create conditional form components
- Implement date validation rules
- Use database transactions for data creation
- Add proper indexes for search performance
- Cache program availability rules
- Handle edge cases in matching logic
