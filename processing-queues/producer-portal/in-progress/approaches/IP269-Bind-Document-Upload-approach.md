# IP269-Bind-Document-Upload - Implementation Approach

## Requirement Understanding
The Document Upload step enables users to submit required documentation digitally during the binding process, including proof of prior insurance, driver's licenses, vehicle registrations, and additional documents. The system must support drag-and-drop uploads, multiple file formats, dynamic document requirements based on policy parameters, and create suspenses for missing documents while allowing progression.

## Domain Classification
- Primary Domain: Producer Portal / Quote Binding
- Cross-Domain Impact: Yes - Affects underwriting, compliance, policy issuance
- Complexity Level: Medium

## Pattern Analysis

### Reusable Patterns Identified
- [GR-69]: Producer Portal Architecture - Document management patterns
- [GR-52]: Universal Entity Management - Document entity reuse
- [GR-41]: Database Standards - File and document storage
- [GR-44]: Communication Architecture - File upload handling
- [GR-20]: Business Logic Standards - Document requirement rules

### Domain-Specific Needs
- Dynamic document requirements based on policy
- Multiple document types per quote
- Drag-and-drop upload interface
- File format and size validation
- Thumbnail preview generation
- Suspense creation for missing documents
- Progress preservation

## Proposed Implementation

### Simplification Approach
- Current Complexity: Dynamic requirements, multiple formats, validation
- Simplified Solution: Leverage existing document/file infrastructure
- Trade-offs: None - existing tables support all needs

### Technical Approach
1. **Phase 1**: Document Requirements
   - [ ] Determine required documents by policy
   - [ ] Query program document rules
   - [ ] Check driver/vehicle specifics
   - [ ] Build dynamic requirements list
   - [ ] Display in card format

2. **Phase 2**: Upload Interface
   - [ ] Implement drag-and-drop zones
   - [ ] Add click-to-browse option
   - [ ] Support PDF, JPEG, PNG formats
   - [ ] Enforce 10MB size limit
   - [ ] Show upload progress

3. **Phase 3**: File Processing
   - [ ] Validate file format
   - [ ] Check file size limits
   - [ ] Store in file table
   - [ ] Create document records
   - [ ] Generate thumbnails

4. **Phase 4**: Document Management
   - [ ] Link documents to quote
   - [ ] Set document_type appropriately
   - [ ] Track upload timestamps
   - [ ] Enable remove/replace
   - [ ] Maintain document state

5. **Phase 5**: Status Tracking
   - [ ] Show upload progress
   - [ ] Display success indicators
   - [ ] Track completion status
   - [ ] Check all requirements met
   - [ ] Update UI dynamically

6. **Phase 6**: Suspense Handling
   - [ ] Validate required documents
   - [ ] Show warning for missing
   - [ ] Create suspense records
   - [ ] Allow continuation
   - [ ] Track for follow-up

## Risk Assessment
- **Risk 1**: Large file handling → Mitigation: Chunked uploads, size limits
- **Risk 2**: Format validation bypass → Mitigation: Server-side verification
- **Risk 3**: Dynamic requirements complexity → Mitigation: Rules engine
- **Risk 4**: Network interruptions → Mitigation: Resumable uploads
- **Risk 5**: Storage scalability → Mitigation: CDN planning

## Context Preservation
- Key Decisions: Use existing document infrastructure, dynamic requirements
- Dependencies: Document types, file storage, suspense system, policy rules
- Future Impact: Foundation for document management throughout policy lifecycle

## Database Requirements Summary
- **New Tables**: 0 tables need to be created
- **Existing Tables**: 6+ tables will be reused as-is
- **Modified Tables**: 0 existing tables need modifications

## Database Schema Analysis

### Core Tables (All Exist)
1. **document**: Document records
   - Has document_type_id for categorization
   - Links to file via file_id
   - Tracks entity relationships
   - Ready for bind documents

2. **document_type**: Document categories
   - Define types like "Prior Insurance", "License"
   - Can add new types as needed
   - Controls requirements

3. **file**: Physical file storage
   - Stores uploaded files
   - Has metadata for additional info
   - Tracks size, type, hash

4. **file_type**: Allowed file formats
   - PDF, JPEG, PNG definitions
   - Size limit configurations
   - MIME type validation

5. **suspense**: Missing document tracking
   - Create for incomplete uploads
   - Track required documents
   - Monitor compliance

6. **map_entity_document**: Document linking
   - Links documents to quotes
   - Flexible entity association
   - Supports multiple documents

### Document Type Examples
```sql
-- Common document types for binding
INSERT INTO document_type (code, name, description, status_id) VALUES
('PRIOR_INSURANCE', 'Proof of Prior Insurance', 'Previous insurance documentation', 1),
('DRIVER_LICENSE', 'Driver License', 'Valid driver license copy', 1),
('VEHICLE_REGISTRATION', 'Vehicle Registration', 'Current vehicle registration', 1),
('ADDITIONAL', 'Additional Documentation', 'Other required documents', 1);
```

### Dynamic Requirements
Store rules in program configuration or use business logic to determine required documents based on:
- State requirements
- Driver age/history
- Vehicle type
- Coverage selections
- Prior insurance status

## Business Summary for Stakeholders
### What We're Building
A digital document upload system that dynamically determines and collects required documentation during policy binding. The system supports drag-and-drop uploads, validates file formats and sizes, provides visual confirmation through thumbnails, and creates compliance tracking for missing documents while allowing the bind process to continue.

### Why It's Needed
Manual document collection delays policy issuance and creates administrative overhead. This digital system streamlines document intake, ensures all required documentation is tracked, reduces processing time, and maintains compliance records. It adapts requirements based on policy specifics, ensuring only necessary documents are requested.

### Expected Outcomes
- Reduced bind processing time through digital uploads
- Improved compliance with systematic tracking
- Better user experience with intuitive upload interface
- Decreased administrative work with automated validation
- Enhanced document organization and retrieval

## Technical Summary for Developers
### Key Technical Decisions
- **Architecture Pattern**: Use existing document/file tables as-is
- **Requirements Engine**: Dynamic rules based on policy parameters
- **Upload Strategy**: Chunked uploads with progress tracking
- **Validation Approach**: Client preview, server verification
- **Storage Pattern**: File table with document metadata

### Implementation Guidelines
- Build dynamic requirements service
- Implement dropzone component
- Create file upload service
- Generate thumbnails client-side
- Validate server-side
- Link via map_entity_document
- Integrate suspense creation
- Handle network failures gracefully
