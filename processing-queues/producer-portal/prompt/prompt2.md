I would like to update our process in the following files where it's appropriate
- Aime/workspace/requirements/PROCESS_GUIDE.md
- Aime/workspace/requirements/README.md
- Aime/workspace/requirements/USER_GUIDE.md
- Aime/workspace/requirements/CLAUDE.md
- Aime/workspace/requirements/ARCHITECTURE.md
  - In our -approach files
    - to include the suggested tables and schemas
    - a section added that outlines what we are trying to accomplish for PM's and Stakeholders
      - Include all business rules we are applying and make sure it's easy to understand exactly what we're doing and why.
    - a section added that outlined what we are trying to accomplish for developers
      - Include all technical rules and decisions we are applying and make sure it's easy to understand exactly what we're doing and why.
    - anything else you feel would help us effecciently validate that we are on the right track for the requirement we need the approach file for. 
  - Is there any information in our process files that is not correct or inaccurate or may be left over from a more complcated process?
    - I want to make sure our process documentation is accurate and effective.
- Aime/workspace/requirements/shared-infrastructure
  - Is this referenced or even used in our current process?
  - If it is, ensure our process dicumentation outlines what it is and what it's for.

In a -plan file, outline all the changes you would make and why and I'll review for approval before anbything is modified.

4. Create a sample enhanced approach file as reference 
 - you dont need to do this if your enhancing the exisiting ones in step 3
