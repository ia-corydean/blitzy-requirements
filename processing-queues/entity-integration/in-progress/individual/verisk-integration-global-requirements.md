## Pre-Analysis Summary

### Existing Documentation Review
We have comprehensive technical documentation for three Verisk products:

1. **AutoCapWithClaims** - Vehicle claims history and activity prediction service
2. **CoverageVerifier V8** - Insurance coverage verification and lapse detection  
3. **LightSpeed V4** - Comprehensive auto insurance data aggregation platform

### Global Requirements Alignment
This initiative aligns with key Global Requirements:
- **GR-52**: Universal Entity Management Architecture - For managing Verisk APIs as external entities
- **GR-48**: External Integrations Catalog - Apache Camel integration platform
- **GR-44**: Communication Architecture - Unified communication tracking
- **GR-53**: DCS Integration Architecture - Pattern reference for external APIs

### Previous Analysis Completed
- Technical specifications analyzed for all three products
- Request/response schemas documented
- Data points and capabilities cataloged
- Authentication and security requirements identified

---

## Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. Generate comprehensive Global Requirements for Verisk product integrations
2. Apply Universal Entity Management pattern for consistent API handling
3. Define standard integration patterns reusable across all insurance domains
4. Establish performance benchmarks and SLA requirements

### Expected Outcomes
- Standardized Verisk entity types in universal entity system
- Apache Camel routes for each Verisk service
- Communication tracking patterns for all API calls
- Security and compliance framework
- Performance monitoring approach

---

## Scope and Approach

### Products in Scope
1. **AutoCapWithClaims**
   - Claims history retrieval
   - Claim Activity Predictor (CAP) scoring
   - Vehicle information and VIN validation
   - SSN verification and death master checks

2. **CoverageVerifier**  
   - Prior coverage verification
   - Coverage lapse detection
   - Policy detail retrieval
   - Analytic attributes and scoring

3. **LightSpeed**
   - Multi-source data aggregation
   - Motor Vehicle Reports (MVR)
   - Risk scoring and fraud detection
   - Household demographics and environmental analysis

### Technical Approach
- **Entity Management**: Each Verisk product as a universal entity type
- **Integration Platform**: Apache Camel for routing and transformation
- **Communication**: Polymorphic tracking with correlation IDs
- **Configuration**: Three-tier hierarchy (entity → program → system)
- **Security**: HashiCorp Vault for credential management

## Key Decisions Already Made

### From Technical Analysis

#### AutoCapWithClaims
- **Authentication**: OrgId and ShipId required
- **Search Types**: VIN, SSN, Driver License, Name/Address, Phone
- **Response Time**: Typically <5 seconds
- **Data Retention**: Claims history 5-7 years
- **Key Value**: CAP score predicts future claim likelihood

#### CoverageVerifier
- **Authentication**: OrgId and ShipId required  
- **Coverage Types**: 61 different coverage codes tracked
- **Lapse Detection**: Precise day-level gap identification
- **Match Scoring**: 1-100 confidence scores
- **Key Value**: Continuous coverage verification

#### LightSpeed
- **Authentication**: OrgId and ShipId required
- **Data Sources**: DMV, carriers, credit bureaus, demographics
- **Risk Scoring**: Multiple proprietary scoring models
- **Response Size**: Can exceed 1000 lines
- **Key Value**: Complete underwriting data in single call

### Integration Patterns Identified
- All services use similar authentication model
- JSON and XML format support across products
- Standard HTTP error codes with custom 588 for validation
- Consistent date format (YYYYMMDD) requirements

---

## Implementation Requirements

### Universal Entity Configuration
Each Verisk product will be configured as an entity type:

```
Entity Types:
- VERISK_AUTOCAP_CLAIMS
- VERISK_COVERAGE_VERIFIER  
- VERISK_LIGHTSPEED

Category: INTEGRATION
```

### Apache Camel Routes Required
1. Authentication management route (shared)
2. Request transformation routes (per product)
3. Response parsing and normalization
4. Error handling and retry logic
5. Circuit breaker implementation

### Communication Tracking
- All API calls logged with correlation IDs
- Request/response data with PII masking
- Performance metrics collection
- Failure tracking for circuit breakers

### Performance Requirements
- AutoCapWithClaims: <5 second response
- CoverageVerifier: <3 second response  
- LightSpeed: <10 second response (large payload)
- Circuit breaker: 5 failures trigger, 60 second timeout

## Next Steps After Approval

### Multi-Agent Processing
1. System Orchestrator will analyze cross-domain implications
2. EntityIntegration specialist will define technical specifications
3. Universal Validator will ensure Global Requirements compliance
4. Pattern recognition will identify reusable components

### Expected Deliverables
1. Complete requirement specification for each Verisk product
2. Database schema for entity configuration
3. Apache Camel route definitions
4. API service implementation patterns
5. Testing and monitoring approach

### Integration Points
- Quote creation workflow (AutoCapWithClaims)
- New business underwriting (CoverageVerifier)
- Risk assessment process (LightSpeed)
- SR22 filing verification (cross-reference)

## Approval Required

**This document requires approval before processing through the multi-agent system.**

Once approved, place this file in the active queue to initiate comprehensive requirement generation for Verisk integrations following all established patterns and Global Requirements.

### Review Checklist
- [ ] Objectives align with business needs
- [ ] Technical approach follows established patterns
- [ ] All three Verisk products adequately covered
- [ ] Integration points correctly identified
- [ ] Performance requirements acceptable
