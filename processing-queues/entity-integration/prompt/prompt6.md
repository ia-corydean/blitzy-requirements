- we need to add action and action_type table
- we need to include log and log_type
- diary and diary_type

create a -v2 of the existing entity-catalogue for testing purposes that would include everything mentioned in entity-catalog-extension-plan-v3.md.
- this is not meant to reaplce the existing one yet.
- I am going to use this for testing for now.

Go through every IndividualRequirement we currently have outlined
- Evaluate what we're trying to accomplish in that file
- Compare the existing requirement to the example entity-catalogue-v2
  - Determine how we accomodate the conceot already outlined with the entities we have defined.
  - Determine if the entity catalogue should be updated to accomodate the global requirement.
  - Determine what changes need to be made in the individual requirement to reflect the updated entity catalogue
  - if there are questions, ask.
- create an -approach version of each global requirement that reflects the information above.
