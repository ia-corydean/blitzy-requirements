- what if we had sr22 and sr26 tables?
- sr22_reason and sr26_reason?
- tenant (multi-tenant context)
  - the system will not be multi-teneant. Each MGA will have their own licensed instance of the system.
- we need an alert and alert_type table
- audit and audit_type table for system audits and other audits
- security_group and _type
- security_permission and _type
- entity_group
  - DCS Household Search would be entity_group of integration entity_type would be Household Search and entity of DCS
  - configuration for this would be in the configuration table and references the entity.
- anything calculation related should be in the calculation table with the appropriate calculation_type reference.
- session and session_type
- system_component and _type
