  - apply these changes for all of the above in -v4 files
    - communication_type vs communication_method vs communication_channel
      - we need to decide on wha the differences here are and find out if we can consolidate
    - correlation_id
      - what does this refer to?
    - level
      - notification_level
    - what if quote had program_id as well policy_id for when it's bound
      - would these give the ability to remove map tables?
    - what if policy had program_id
      - would these give the ability to remove map tables?
    - what if driver had entity_type_id and entity_id for quote and policy stages.
      - would these give the ability to remove map tables?
    - what if vehicle had entity_type_id and entity_id for quote and policy stages.
      - would these give the ability to remove map tables?
    - what if loss had policy_id
      - would these give the ability to remove map tables?
    - we need a relationship_to_insured table
      - each driver will have an associated id to this table
    - Every table MUST include these fields:
      - include status_id
    - add coverage and coverage_type table
    - remove reference of agency_id
    - there needs to be better seperation of data that goes into entity, entity_type and configuration
    - configuration
      - should include entity_type_id and entity_id to mitigate map tables
    - we need integration and integration_type table for third party integrations
        - entity_type_id and entity_id
        - types like
          - criminal_history
          - household_driver
          - household_vehicle
          - payment_gateway
          - sms
          - email
    - need better understanding for transaction, transaction_line, and calculation

go through these and see where updates need to take place and what changes would be reflected in the -v4 files.
- output a detailed -summary file in GlobalRequirements/IndividualRequirements/approaches for review and approval before you make the -v4 files.
