  - policy_id
  - program_id
- policy
  - program_id
- doing the entity_id and entity_type_id trick on tables like program, policy, loss, driver going to make it harder for reporting
  - is this correct? what are your thoughts?
  - maybe we should have map tables?
    - map_policy_driver
    - map_policy_vehicle
    - map_policy_loss
    - map_quote_driver
    - map_quote_vehicle
    - program is going to have the most map tables because it sets up what's available for everything to use and refernce and normally has multiple mappings.
      - map_program_coverage
      - map_program_discount
      - map_program_surcharge
      - map_program_fee
      - map_program_payment_plan
      - map_program_integration
      - map_program_territory
      - map_program_factor
      - map_program_producer
      - map_program_entity
      - map_program_communication_preference
      - map_communication_integration
        - if integration stored all requests and responses this would have communication just be the table for the actual content of the communication
      - map_program_configuration
        - this would allow for clearer and better defined configuration with configuration.configuration_type
      - etc..
      - there can be multiple programs in the system and different iterations of these mappings per program.
        - We are needing to be able to easily add update and maintain these types associations with workflows and user interfaces.
      - map_entity_configuration
        - this would allow for clearer and better defined configuration with configuration.configuration_type
      - map_integration_configuration
        - this would allow for clearer and better defined configuration with configuration.configuration_type
      - map_entity_integration
        - this would tie an entity to multiple integrations cleanly.
    - although map_ tables increase the database, it seems to have advantages for our use case.
      - we need to accomodate robust reporting down to the field level
      - machine learning and ai will be in the future
      - what's your suggestion on how to approash map_ files?
        - are we making the right choice?
        - what are the implications at scale?
          - I feel like once all tables are clearly defined - which there will be a lot - the infrstructure shouldnt change much.
            - if it does, it's should be easier to add things to entities without killing relationships
            - it should be able to transfer polcies from producers
            - although the database will be huge (as far as tables) data should be organized well and easier to maintain at scale
- deductible and deductible_type need to be added
- driver_alert and _type
- policy_alert and _type
- any enitites not defined in GlobalRequirements/IndividualRequirements/approaches/-additional-entities.md or shared-infrastructure/knowledge-base/universal-entity-catalog-v2-updated.json and are defined in our requirements, should be provided in this summary for review to be added to GlobalRequirements/IndividualRequirements/approaches/-additional-entities.md.
- create a v5-changes-summary file with your response and as an updated version of v4-changes-summary
