# DCS Integration - Global Requirements Initiative

**Status:** DRAFT - Awaiting Approval  
**Date:** 2025-01-07  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Domain:** EntityIntegration  

---

## Pre-Analysis Summary

### Existing Documentation Review
We have comprehensive technical documentation for three DCS products:

1. **Criminal API v1.0** - Criminal history search service by name and date of birth
2. **Household Drivers API v2.7** - Driver's license information with criminal history integration  
3. **Household Vehicles API v2.3** - Vehicle registration, title, and lienholder information

### Global Requirements Alignment
This initiative aligns with key Global Requirements:
- **GR-52**: Universal Entity Management Architecture - For managing DCS APIs as external entities
- **GR-48**: External Integrations Catalog - Apache Camel integration platform
- **GR-44**: Communication Architecture - Unified communication tracking
- **GR-53**: DCS Integration Architecture - Specific patterns for DCS services
- **GR-19**: Status Management - For tracking API response statuses
- **GR-41**: Database Design Standards - For entity storage patterns

### Previous Analysis Completed
- Technical specifications analyzed for all three APIs
- Authentication patterns documented (HTTP Basic Auth)
- Request/response schemas cataloged
- Search capabilities and limitations identified
- Error handling and status codes documented

---

## Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. Generate comprehensive Global Requirements for DCS API integrations
2. Apply Universal Entity Management pattern for consistent API handling
3. Define standard integration patterns for criminal, driver, and vehicle searches
4. Establish performance benchmarks and retry strategies
5. Implement secure credential management for Basic Authentication

### Expected Outcomes
- Standardized DCS entity types in universal entity system
- Apache Camel routes for each DCS service
- Communication tracking patterns for all API calls
- Security framework for Basic Auth credentials
- Performance monitoring and circuit breaker implementation
- Reusable patterns for address-based searches

---

## Scope and Approach

### Products in Scope
1. **Criminal API**
   - Name and date of birth searches
   - Criminal history retrieval
   - Alias name tracking
   - Multiple profile handling for common names

2. **Household Drivers API**  
   - Address-based driver searches
   - Individual driver lookups (DL# or name/DOB)
   - Criminal history integration
   - Associated DL numbers and prior addresses
   - Version 2.7 alias search enhancements

3. **Household Vehicles API**
   - Address-based vehicle searches
   - VIN-specific lookups
   - License plate (tag) searches
   - Title and lienholder information
   - Registration status and history

### Technical Approach
- **Entity Management**: Each DCS API as a universal entity type
- **Authentication**: HTTP Basic Auth with secure credential storage
- **Integration Platform**: Apache Camel for routing and transformation
- **Communication**: Polymorphic tracking with correlation IDs
- **Configuration**: Three-tier hierarchy (entity → program → system)
- **Security**: HashiCorp Vault for Basic Auth credentials

---

## Key Decisions Already Made

### From Technical Analysis

#### Criminal API
- **Authentication**: Account Number:User ID:Password in Base64
- **Search Method**: Name + DOB only (no SSN/DL# available)
- **Response Time**: Target <3 seconds
- **Data Points**: Offenses, convictions, dispositions, sentencing
- **Key Challenge**: No unique identifiers for deduplication

#### Household Drivers API
- **Authentication**: Same Basic Auth pattern as Criminal API  
- **Search Types**: Address, DL Number, or Name/DOB
- **Address Status Codes**: Found, ANNF, ANNS, HNNF, SNNF
- **Record Limit**: Maximum 100 drivers per response
- **Key Value**: Links drivers to addresses with criminal history

#### Household Vehicles API
- **Authentication**: Same Basic Auth pattern across all APIs
- **Search Methods**: Three separate endpoints (Address, VIN, Tag)
- **Data Coverage**: Title, registration, liens, vehicle details
- **Privacy Flags**: DPPA compliance indicators
- **Key Value**: Complete vehicle ownership and status

### Integration Patterns Identified
- All services use HTTP Basic Authentication
- XML primary format (JSON supported for some)
- POST method exclusively
- TransactionInfo required in all requests
- Consistent error code structure
- Address standardization critical for searches

---

## Implementation Requirements

### Universal Entity Configuration
Each DCS API will be configured as an entity type:

```
Entity Types:
- DCS_CRIMINAL_SEARCH
- DCS_HOUSEHOLD_DRIVERS  
- DCS_HOUSEHOLD_VEHICLES

Category: INTEGRATION
Subcategory: BACKGROUND_CHECK
```

### Apache Camel Routes Required
1. Basic Auth credential management (shared)
2. Address standardization route
3. Request transformation routes (per API)
4. Response parsing and normalization
5. Error handling with specific status codes
6. Circuit breaker implementation

### Communication Tracking
- All API calls logged with correlation IDs
- Request data with PII masking (SSN partial, full DOB masked)
- Response size and timing metrics
- Search type and result counts
- Failure reasons for troubleshooting

### Performance Requirements
- Criminal API: <3 second response target
- Household Drivers: <5 second response target  
- Household Vehicles: <5 second response target
- Circuit breaker: 3 failures trigger, 30 second timeout
- Retry strategy: Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)

### Address Handling Requirements
- Standardize addresses before searches
- Handle apartment/unit parsing
- Implement fallback for address not found statuses
- Cache successful address resolutions

---

## Next Steps After Approval

### Multi-Agent Processing
1. System Orchestrator will analyze cross-domain implications
2. EntityIntegration specialist will define technical specifications
3. Universal Validator will ensure Global Requirements compliance
4. Pattern recognition will identify reusable components
5. Security specialist will review credential management

### Expected Deliverables
1. Complete requirement specifications for each DCS API
2. Database schema for entity configuration and caching
3. Apache Camel route definitions with error handling
4. API service implementation patterns
5. Address standardization service specification
6. Testing approach including mock data generation
7. Monitoring and alerting configuration

### Integration Points
- Quote creation workflow (driver/vehicle verification)
- New business underwriting (criminal background checks)
- Policy renewal process (updated driver/vehicle info)
- Claims investigation (criminal history relevance)
- SR22/SR26 filing support (driver validation)
- Address validation services (standardization)

---

## Special Considerations

### Data Privacy and Compliance
- DPPA compliance for vehicle data
- Criminal record usage restrictions
- PII handling and masking requirements
- Audit logging for all searches
- Purpose codes for legitimate use

### Error Handling Strategy
- Address not found: Attempt without apartment number
- Multiple matches: Return all with confidence scores
- No records found: Explicit empty response
- Authentication failures: Credential rotation alerts
- Service unavailable: Circuit breaker activation

### Caching Strategy
- Address standardization results: 30 days
- Criminal searches: No caching (real-time only)
- Driver lookups: 24 hour cache for same search
- Vehicle data: 7 day cache by VIN

## Approval Required

**This document requires approval before processing through the multi-agent system.**

Once approved, place this file in the active queue to initiate comprehensive requirement generation for DCS integrations following all established patterns and Global Requirements.

### Review Checklist
- [ ] Objectives align with business needs
- [ ] Technical approach follows established patterns
- [ ] All three DCS APIs adequately covered
- [ ] Authentication strategy appropriate for Basic Auth
- [ ] Integration points correctly identified
- [ ] Performance requirements acceptable
- [ ] Privacy and compliance considerations addressed
- [ ] Address handling strategy comprehensive
- [ ] Caching policies appropriate for data types

**Note**: This is an initial requirements outline based on existing DCS documentation analysis. The multi-agent system will expand this into comprehensive implementation requirements upon approval. Key differences from other integrations include HTTP Basic Authentication, address-based searching patterns, and the absence of unique identifiers for criminal searches.
