lets create an approach file for ProgramRater global requirements and the ProgramManager global requirements.
- All rating elements and program details are defined in processing-queues/program-traits/pending
- Our existing GlobalRequirements and Aime/workspace/requirements/shared-infrastructure/knowledge-base/universal-entity-catalog-v2.json should help with what's already established.
- processing-queues/program-manager/pending/program-manager-requirements.md outlines the still-in-progress plan for the ProgramManager
  - Take this as a heavy source for how we plan on managing the program in the system as well as the rating aspects per program
