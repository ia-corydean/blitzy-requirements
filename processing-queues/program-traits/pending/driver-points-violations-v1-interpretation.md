## 3. Business Rules

### Data Source Integration
- **Verisk Aplus**: Primary source for accident data
- **Verisk Incident Alert**: Primary source for driver violation data
- **RTR System**: Expected additional violation mappings from system provider
- **Verisk Codes**: Standard industry codes for cross-system compatibility

### Point Assignment Logic
- **At-Fault Determinations**: Only at-fault accidents receive point assignments
- **Progressive Penalties**: Escalating point structure for repeat violations
- **Administrative Actions**: Limited point assignment for administrative violations
- **Equipment Violations**: Generally no point assignment for minor equipment issues

### System Processing Rules
- **Real-Time Integration**: Direct connection to Verisk data sources
- **Code Mapping**: Automatic translation between Verisk codes and internal violation numbers
- **Exception Handling**: Process for unmapped or new violation types
- **Data Validation**: Verification of Verisk data accuracy and completeness

## 4. Premium Impact Examples

### At-Fault Accident Progression
**Massachusetts Surchargeable Accident (Verisk 242100)**
- First Occurrence: 3 points
- Second Occurrence: 4 points
- Third Occurrence: 6 points
- Impact: Progressive premium increase with each subsequent at-fault accident

### Personal Injury vs Property Damage
**Personal Injury At-Fault (Verisk 242110)**
- Point Assignment: 3-4-6 (same as property damage)
- Additional tracking for claims severity analysis

**Property Damage At-Fault (Verisk 242120)**
- Point Assignment: 3-4-6
- Standard at-fault accident treatment

### Administrative Action Impact
**Administrative Denial (Verisk 580035)**
- First/Second Occurrence: 1 point each
- Third Occurrence: 2 points
- Lower impact reflecting administrative rather than driving behavior
