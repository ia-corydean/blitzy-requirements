- **Managing General Agency**: Aguila Dorada
- **Program**: Private Passenger Auto
- **Effective Date**: New Business 07/15/2025, Renewal 08/15/2025

## 2. Assignment Methodology

### Primary Assignment Rule
The Driver Assignment system uses a **highest-to-highest methodology** where:
- **Highest rated driver** is assigned to **highest rated vehicle**
- **Second highest rated driver** is assigned to **second highest rated vehicle**
- **Pattern continues** for all drivers and vehicles on the policy

### Rating Hierarchy Determination
**Driver Rating Order (Highest to Lowest):**
1. Driver with highest individual rating factors
2. Combination of Driver Class + Driver Points factors
3. Age, gender, marital status, and violation history considered
4. Most expensive driver receives priority assignment

**Vehicle Rating Order (Highest to Lowest):**
1. Vehicle with highest individual rating factors
2. Combination of Vehicle Age + Use + Make/Model factors
3. Most expensive vehicle receives priority assignment
4. Vehicle value and risk characteristics considered

## 3. Assignment Process

### Step-by-Step Methodology
1. **Calculate Driver Ratings**: Determine each driver's individual rating factors
2. **Calculate Vehicle Ratings**: Determine each vehicle's individual rating factors
3. **Rank Drivers**: Order drivers from highest to lowest rating cost
4. **Rank Vehicles**: Order vehicles from highest to lowest rating cost
5. **Assign Sequentially**: Match highest driver to highest vehicle, continuing down the list

### Multi-Driver, Multi-Vehicle Example
**Policy with 3 Drivers and 2 Vehicles:**
- Driver A (highest rated) → Vehicle 1 (highest rated)
- Driver B (second highest) → Vehicle 2 (second highest)
- Driver C (lowest rated) → No primary assignment (unlisted on vehicles)

## 4. Rating Factor Application

### Assigned Driver Factors
**Factors Applied to Assigned Vehicle:**
- Driver Class factor (age, gender, marital status)
- Driver Points factor (violation history)
- Driver-specific discounts or surcharges
- Experience and licensing factors

**Coverage Application:**

- Physical damage coverage rated using assigned driver factors
- Medical coverage rated using assigned driver factors
