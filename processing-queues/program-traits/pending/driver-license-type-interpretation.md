# Driver License Type Rate Factor Interpretation
## Aguila Dorada Texas Personal Auto Program

### Overview
This document provides the complete factual interpretation of the Driver License Type rate factor for the Aguila Dorada Texas Personal Auto insurance program. This factor evaluates the risk associated with different types of driver identification documents and applies coverage-specific multipliers to adjust premiums based on the driver's license status and legitimacy verification capabilities.

## 1. Factor Identification

### Factor Details
- **Factor Name**: Driver License Type (LICENSE TYPE)
- **Company**: Old American County Mutual
- **Managing General Agency**: Aguila Dorada
- **Program**: Private Passenger Auto
- **Effective Date**: New Business 07/15/2025, Renewal 08/15/2025
- **System**: New System Implementation

### Coverage Application
This factor applies multipliers to all major coverage categories:
- Bodily Injury (BI)
- Property Damage (PD)
- Uninsured Motorist Bodily Injury (UMBI)
- Uninsured Motorist Property Damage (UMPD)
- Medical Payments (MED)

## 2. Factor Structure and Definitions

### License Type Categories
The factor recognizes seven distinct driver identification categories with varying risk profiles:

**Texas DL (Texas Driver's License)**
- Base rate multiplier (1.000) across all coverages
- Represents the lowest risk category
- Full verification and validation available through Texas DPS systems

**Texas ID (Texas Identification Card)**
- Higher multipliers ranging from 1.100 to 1.200
- Indicates non-driving status or driving privilege issues
- Limited validation capabilities compared to driver's license

**US DL, State other than Texas**
- Moderate multipliers with coverage variation
- BI/PD: 1.100 surcharge
- UMBI/UMPD/MED: No surcharge (1.000)
- PIP: 1.100 surcharge
- COMP: No surcharge (1.000)
- COLL: 1.150 surcharge

**Foreign DL / International DL**
- Consistent higher multipliers across most coverages
- Higher risk due to verification limitations and driving law differences
- Multipliers range from 1.100 to 1.200

**Matricula (Mexican Consular Identification)**
- Base rate treatment (1.000) across all coverages
- Special consideration for Mexican nationals
- Acceptable identification for this program

**Passport**
- Base rate treatment (1.000) across all coverages
- Federal identification document
- Acceptable for program purposes despite non-driving status

**No Driver's License**
- Highest multipliers across all coverages
- Represents highest risk category
- BI/PD: 1.300 (30% surcharge)
- All other coverages: 1.250 (25% surcharge)

## 3. Business Rules

### Coverage-Specific Multiplier Application

#### Liability Coverages (BI/PD)
- Texas DL: 1.000 (base)
- Texas ID: 1.150 (15% surcharge)
- US DL (other states): 1.100 (10% surcharge)
- Foreign/International DL: 1.100 (10% surcharge)
- Matricula: 1.000 (base)
- Passport: 1.000 (base)
- No License: 1.300 (30% surcharge)

#### Uninsured Motorist Coverages (UMBI/UMPD)
- Follows different pattern than liability
- Some license types receive base rate treatment
- Foreign licenses carry higher multipliers

#### Physical Damage Coverages (COMP/COLL)
- Highest multipliers in this category
- Comprehensive and Collision often have identical factors
- Texas ID and Foreign licenses receive significant surcharges

#### Medical Coverages (MED/PIP)
- Generally moderate surcharges
- Medical coverage (MED) typically lower than PIP
- Recognition of medical necessity regardless of license status

### Renewal Processing Rules
- **Renewal Review**: License status checked at renewal for updates and rate adjustments
- **Driver Status Check (DSC)**: System runs DSC at renewal to verify if driver has obtained Texas license
- **Rate Improvement Opportunity**: Drivers who obtain valid Texas licenses receive automatic rate reductions
- **Status Verification**: System validates license status through available verification systems

### Application Hierarchy
- Most restrictive license type applies when multiple documents available
- Texas Driver's License takes precedence when valid
- Current status determines rating regardless of historical license types
- Mid-term license improvements can trigger rate adjustments

## 4. Premium Impact Examples

### Base Premium Scenario
For a driver with base premium of $1,000 across all coverages:

**Texas DL Driver:**
- All coverages: $1,000 (no surcharge)
- Total impact: $0

**Texas ID Holder:**
- BI: $1,000 × 1.150 = $1,150 (+$150)
- PD: $1,000 × 1.150 = $1,150 (+$150)
- UMBI: $1,000 × 1.150 = $1,150 (+$150)
- UMPD: $1,000 × 1.150 = $1,150 (+$150)
- MED: $1,000 × 1.100 = $1,100 (+$100)
- PIP: $1,000 × 1.150 = $1,150 (+$150)
- COMP: $1,000 × 1.200 = $1,200 (+$200)
- COLL: $1,000 × 1.200 = $1,200 (+$200)
- Total surcharge impact: +$1,250

**No License Driver:**
- BI: $1,000 × 1.300 = $1,300 (+$300)
- PD: $1,000 × 1.300 = $1,300 (+$300)
- All other coverages: $1,000 × 1.250 = $1,250 (+$250 each)
- Total surcharge impact: +$2,100

### Risk Differential Analysis
The multiplier spread demonstrates clear risk stratification:
- **Lowest Risk**: Texas DL, Matricula, Passport (1.000 base)
- **Moderate Risk**: Out-of-state US DL (1.000-1.150 range)
- **Higher Risk**: Texas ID, Foreign DL (1.100-1.200 range)
- **Highest Risk**: No license (1.250-1.300 range)
