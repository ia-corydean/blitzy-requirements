## 2. Vehicle Usage Factor Structure

### Usage Classifications and Factors
**All Coverage Types (BI, PD, UMBI, UMPD, MED, PIP, COMP, COLL):**

#### Pleasure Use
- **Factor**: 1.000 (base rate)
- **Description**: Vehicle used primarily for pleasure driving
- **Code**: P
- **Risk Level**: Baseline risk for recreational vehicle use

#### Commute ≤ 5 Miles One Way
- **Factor**: 1.025 (2.5% surcharge)
- **Description**: Vehicle used for commuting 5 miles or less one way
- **Code**: A
- **Risk Level**: Slight increase due to regular commuting exposure

#### Commute > 5 Miles One Way
- **Factor**: 1.050 (5% surcharge)
- **Description**: Vehicle used for commuting more than 5 miles one way
- **Code**: C
- **Risk Level**: Moderate increase due to extended commuting exposure

#### Business Use
- **Factor**: 1.250 (25% surcharge)
- **Description**: Vehicle used for business purposes
- **Code**: B
- **Risk Level**: Highest surcharge due to commercial usage exposure

#### Farm Use
- **Factor**: 1.100 (10% surcharge)
- **Description**: Vehicle used for farm operations
- **Code**: F
- **Risk Level**: Moderate surcharge for agricultural usage

#### Non-Owner
- **Factor**: 1.000 (base rate)
- **Description**: Non-owner policy coverage
- **Code**: None specified
- **Risk Level**: Base rate for non-owner policies

## 3. Usage Classification Analysis

### Risk-Based Factor Progression
**Usage Types by Risk Level:**

#### Lowest Risk (1.000 Factor)
- **Pleasure Use**: Recreational driving with limited exposure
- **Non-Owner**: No vehicle ownership, different risk profile

#### Low Risk (1.025 Factor)
- **Short Commute**: Limited regular driving with minimal increased exposure

#### Moderate Risk (1.050 and 1.100 Factors)
- **Long Commute**: Extended regular driving with increased exposure
- **Farm Use**: Agricultural usage with moderate commercial exposure

#### Highest Risk (1.250 Factor)
- **Business Use**: Commercial usage with maximum exposure and risk

### Commute Distance Differentiation
**Distance-Based Risk Assessment:**
- **≤ 5 Miles One Way**: 2.5% surcharge recognizes limited increased exposure
- **> 5 Miles One Way**: 5% surcharge reflects higher mileage and exposure
- **Risk Logic**: Longer commutes increase accident probability due to time on road
- **Distance Threshold**: 5-mile threshold creates clear risk differentiation

## 4. Coverage Application Rules

### Universal Coverage Impact
- **All Coverage Types**: Same usage factor applies to all coverage types
- **Consistent Application**: No coverage-specific usage variations
- **Multiplicative Effect**: Usage factor multiplies all coverage premiums
- **Policy-Level Application**: Single usage classification per vehicle

### Usage Classification Rules
- **Primary Use**: Classification based on primary vehicle usage
- **Customer Declaration**: Customer declares intended vehicle usage
- **Verification**: Usage may be verified through underwriting
- **Change Procedures**: Usage changes require policy endorsement

## 5. Business Rules

### Usage Classification Determination
**Classification Criteria:**
- **Pleasure**: Recreational, personal, and non-business use
- **Commute**: Regular travel to/from work or school
- **Business**: Commercial use, business travel, or income-generating activities
- **Farm**: Agricultural operations and farm-related activities
- **Non-Owner**: Policies without vehicle ownership

### Distance Measurement
**Commute Distance Rules:**
- **One-Way Measurement**: Distance measured one way to work/school
- **Primary Location**: Distance to primary work or school location
- **Regular Usage**: Based on regular commuting pattern
- **Documentation**: Distance may require verification or documentation

### Business Use Definition
**Business Use Criteria:**
- **Commercial Activities**: Vehicle used for business operations
- **Income Generation**: Vehicle used to generate income
- **Business Travel**: Regular business-related travel
- **Delivery Services**: Vehicle used for delivery or service calls

## 6. Premium Impact Examples

### Sample Premium Calculations
**Base Premium (Before Usage Factor): $1,000**

#### Pleasure Use Impact
- **Premium**: $1,000 × 1.000 = $1,000
- **Impact**: No adjustment, base rate
- **Usage**: Recreational and personal driving only

#### Short Commute Impact
- **Premium**: $1,000 × 1.025 = $1,025
- **Surcharge**: $25 (2.5% increase)
- **Usage**: Commuting 5 miles or less one way

#### Long Commute Impact
- **Premium**: $1,000 × 1.050 = $1,050
- **Surcharge**: $50 (5% increase)
- **Usage**: Commuting more than 5 miles one way

#### Business Use Impact
- **Premium**: $1,000 × 1.250 = $1,250
- **Surcharge**: $250 (25% increase)
- **Usage**: Commercial or business-related vehicle use

#### Farm Use Impact
- **Premium**: $1,000 × 1.100 = $1,100
- **Surcharge**: $100 (10% increase)
- **Usage**: Agricultural and farm operations

## 7. Risk Assessment Logic

### Usage-Based Risk Factors
**Risk Considerations:**
- **Mileage Exposure**: Higher usage typically correlates with higher mileage
- **Traffic Conditions**: Business and commute usage involve more traffic exposure
- **Time of Day**: Commute usage involves peak traffic times
- **Purpose Stress**: Business usage may involve time pressure and stress

### Distance-Based Risk Differentiation
**Commute Distance Logic:**
- **Short Commute Risk**: Limited additional exposure beyond pleasure use
- **Long Commute Risk**: Significant additional exposure requiring higher factor
- **Risk Progression**: Factor increases with distance and exposure time
- **Actuarial Basis**: Factors reflect historical loss experience by usage type

### Commercial vs. Personal Use
**Business Use Risk Factors:**
- **Commercial Exposure**: Business use involves different risk profile
- **Professional Requirements**: Business use may involve delivery, appointments, etc.
- **Vehicle Loading**: Business vehicles may carry equipment or cargo
- **Liability Exposure**: Increased liability exposure from business activities
