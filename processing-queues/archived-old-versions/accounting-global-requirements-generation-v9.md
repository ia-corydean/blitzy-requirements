# Accounting Global Requirements Generation - Version 9 (Paysafe Integration)

## Executive Summary

Version 9 enhances the accounting requirements by integrating Paysafe's secure payment tokenization platform while removing batch check processing functionality. The system maintains its foundation on transaction and transaction_line tables, ensuring zero storage of sensitive payment data through Paysafe's token-based architecture. This version incorporates program-configurable grace periods, ACH NACHA file generation for positive pay, and maintains the principle that full minimum down payment is required for all transactions.

## Core Business Principles

### 1. Equity-Based Accounting System
- Every financial transaction must maintain the fundamental accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Equity
- All business events must generate balanced journal entries with equal debits and credits
- No single-entry shortcuts or unbalanced transactions permitted
- Complete audit trail from business event to financial impact

### 2. Program-Centric Configuration
- Each insurance program defines its own financial rules and configurations
- Payment plans, fee structures, and commission rates are program-specific
- Grace periods are program-configurable (not fixed at 11/12 days)
- Business rules must be configurable without code changes
- Self-service administration for program managers

### 3. Zero Sensitive Data Storage
- No credit card numbers or bank account details stored in our database
- All payment methods represented by Paysafe tokens
- Payment data secured by Paysafe's PCI-certified infrastructure
- Only tokens and non-sensitive metadata retained locally

### 4. Audit-First Design
- Every financial transaction must be traceable to its originating business event
- Permanent retention of all financial calculations for bound policies
- Complete transparency in premium calculations and fee applications
- Real-time financial reporting without batch processing dependencies

### 5. Modular and Extensible
- New fee types, adjustment reasons, and payment methods through configuration
- Flexible API interface for connecting to payment gateways/providers
- Extensible proof rules and document requirements
- Support for future payment innovations through gateway abstraction

## Functional Requirements

### Transaction Management

#### Core Transaction Requirements
- Support for all insurance business events: quotes, bindings, endorsements, cancellations, reinstatements
- Transaction types must include: PREMIUM, FEE, COMMISSION, PAYMENT, ADJUSTMENT, REFUND
- Each transaction must capture the complete context of the business event
- Transactions must be immutable once created (no edits, only adjustments)

#### Transaction Components
- Every transaction must break down into detailed line items
- Line items must specify: account classification, debit/credit amounts, component type
- Component types include: PREMIUM, POLICY_FEE, MVCPA_FEE, SR22_FEE, INSTALLMENT_FEE, COMMISSION, TAX

### Payment Processing with Paysafe Integration

#### Token-Based Payment Architecture
- **Customer Entry**: Payment information entered through Paysafe's secure hosted fields
- **Direct Transmission**: Data sent directly to Paysafe, bypassing our servers
- **Token Reception**: Paysafe returns unique tokens representing payment methods
- **Local Storage**: Only tokens and non-sensitive metadata stored in our system
- **Payment Processing**: All transactions use tokens through Paysafe's API

#### Payment Method Support
The system must support multiple payment methods through Paysafe tokenization:
- **Credit Card**: Real-time processing with zero-dollar authorization
- **ACH (Insured E-Check)**: Electronic check processing with bank validation
- **Agent E-Check (Sweep)**: Agency account sweep payments
- **Mailed-In Payment**: Physical check and money order processing (single check posting only)

#### What We Store Locally
- Paysafe token (unique identifier)
- Payment method type (card/bank)
- Last 4 digits (for display only)  
- Expiration date (for monitoring)
- Customer-defined nickname
- Verification status and history
- Transaction identifiers and amounts

#### Mailed-In Payment Processing
When processing physical payments, the system must capture:
- **Postmarked Date**: Date payment was mailed (for timeliness determination)
- **Payment Type**: Check or money order
- **Check Number**: For tracking and reconciliation
- **Check Amount**: Payment amount to be applied

#### Payment Application Rules

##### Full Payment Requirement
- **Minimum Down Payment**: Full minimum down payment required for all transactions
- **No Partial Initial Payments**: System rejects any payment less than required minimum
- **Payment Validation**: Real-time verification against policy requirements

##### Payment Allocation Scenario
When payment equals or exceeds the billed invoice amount:
1. Apply payment to the billed unsatisfied invoice
2. If payment exceeds invoice amount:
   - Apply balance to policy balance
   - Recalculate all future bills based on new balance
   - System may eliminate final installments if overpayment is sufficient

##### Insufficient Payment Handling
When payment is less than the billed invoice amount:
1. System validates against full minimum down requirement
2. If payment meets minimum requirements:
   - Determine if payment provides enough premium to carry policy to next due date + grace period
   - If sufficient coverage exists:
     - Satisfy the current bill
     - Apply shortage to policy balance
     - Recalculate all future bills
3. If insufficient coverage:
   - Apply payment to current bill
   - Leave difference as open invoice
   - If cancellation not already pending:
     - Calculate paid-to date
     - Process cancellation based on paid-to date
     - Prevent unnecessary refunds

### Payment Plan Management

#### Payment Plan Options

- **Paid-in-Full Options**: Single payment with appropriate discounts

#### Dynamic Installment Generation
- First installment must be created at policy binding
- Subsequent installments generated just-in-time as previous ones are paid
- System must maintain 2-3 future installments for visibility
- Each installment must show itemized components:
  - Premium portion (calculated as daily rate Ã— days in period)
  - Applicable fees broken down by type
  - Total amount due

#### Payment Processing Rules
- **Full Payment Allocation Only**: No partial payment acceptance at transaction level
- **Oldest-First Application**: Payments apply to oldest pending installments first
- **Multi-Installment Payments**: Single payment can satisfy multiple installments
- **Overpayment Handling**: Excess amounts redistribute across remaining installments
- **Equity-Based Redistribution**: Overpayments may eliminate final installments
- **Per-Policy Basis**: All premium payments processed independently per policy

### Cancellation Management

#### Cancellation Timing Rules
- **Program-Configurable Grace Periods**: Each program defines its own grace period (not fixed at 11/12 days)
- Calculate days of coverage based on payment amount
- Determine cancellation effective date to prevent refunds when possible
- Automatic cancellation processing at 12:01 AM on cancellation date

#### Paid-To Date Calculations
- System must calculate exact paid-to date based on:
  - Premium paid
  - Daily premium rate
  - Days of coverage provided
- Prevent cancellation if payment extends coverage beyond grace period

### Fee Management
