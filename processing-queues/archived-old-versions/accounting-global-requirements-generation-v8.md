# Accounting Global Requirements Generation - Version 8 (Enhanced Payment Workflows)

## Executive Summary

Version 8 enhances the accounting requirements with detailed payment workflow specifications from the Make A Payment documentation. The system maintains its foundation on transaction and transaction_line tables while providing comprehensive payment processing capabilities for both online and mailed-in payments. This version ensures we keep the accounting foundation simple while supporting complex business requirements.

## Core Business Principles

### 1. Equity-Based Accounting System
- Every financial transaction must maintain the fundamental accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Equity
- All business events must generate balanced journal entries with equal debits and credits
- No single-entry shortcuts or unbalanced transactions permitted
- Complete audit trail from business event to financial impact

### 2. Program-Centric Configuration
- Each insurance program defines its own financial rules and configurations
- Payment plans, fee structures, and commission rates are program-specific
- Business rules must be configurable without code changes
- Self-service administration for program managers

### 3. Audit-First Design
- Every financial transaction must be traceable to its originating business event
- Permanent retention of all financial calculations for bound policies
- Complete transparency in premium calculations and fee applications
- Real-time financial reporting without batch processing dependencies

### 4. Modular and Extensible
- New fee types, adjustment reasons, and payment methods through configuration
- Flexible commission structures supporting various calculation bases
- Extensible proof rules and document requirements
- Gateway integration flexibility for payment processors

## Functional Requirements

### Transaction Management

#### Core Transaction Requirements
- Support for all insurance business events: quotes, bindings, endorsements, cancellations, reinstatements
- Transaction types must include: PREMIUM, FEE, COMMISSION, PAYMENT, ADJUSTMENT, REFUND
- Each transaction must capture the complete context of the business event
- Transactions must be immutable once created (no edits, only adjustments)

#### Transaction Components
- Every transaction must break down into detailed line items
- Line items must specify: account classification, debit/credit amounts, component type
- Component types include: PREMIUM, POLICY_FEE, MVCPA_FEE, SR22_FEE, INSTALLMENT_FEE, COMMISSION, TAX
- Support for jurisdiction-specific fee requirements

### Payment Processing Workflows

#### Payment Method Support
The system must support multiple payment methods with consistent processing rules:
- **Credit Card**: Real-time processing through payment gateway
- **ACH (Insured E-Check)**: Electronic check processing from insureds
- **Agent E-Check (Sweep)**: Agency account sweep payments
- **Mailed-In Payment**: Physical check and money order processing

#### Mailed-In Payment Processing
When processing physical payments, the system must capture:
- **Postmarked Date**: Date payment was mailed (for timeliness determination)
- **Payment Type**: Check or money order
- **Check Number**: For tracking and reconciliation
- **Check Amount**: Payment amount to be applied

#### Payment Application Rules

##### Full Payment Scenario
When payment equals or exceeds the billed invoice amount:
1. Apply payment to the billed unsatisfied invoice
2. If payment exceeds invoice amount:
   - Apply balance to policy balance
   - Recalculate all future bills based on new balance
   - System may eliminate final installments if overpayment is sufficient

##### Partial Payment Scenario
When payment is less than the billed invoice amount:
1. System must determine if payment provides enough premium to carry policy to next due date + 11/12 days
2. If sufficient coverage exists:
   - Satisfy the current bill
   - Apply shortage to policy balance
   - Recalculate all future bills
3. If insufficient coverage:
   - Apply payment to current bill
   - Leave difference as open invoice
   - If cancellation not already pending:
     - Calculate paid-to date
     - Process cancellation based on paid-to date
     - Prevent unnecessary refunds

#### Batch Payment Processing

  - Total amount due

#### Payment Processing Rules
- **Full Payment Allocation Only**: No partial payment acceptance at transaction level
- **Oldest-First Application**: Payments apply to oldest pending installments first
- **Multi-Installment Payments**: Single payment can satisfy multiple installments
