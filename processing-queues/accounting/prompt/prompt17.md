Does the approach in Aime/workspace/requirements/processing-queues/accounting/in-progress/approaches/accounting-simplified-approach.md actually accommodate all requirements in Aime/workspace/requirements/processing-queues/accounting/pending/accounting-global-requirements-generation-v10.md?
- Do an analaysis on how everything in -v10.md fits within the schema you provided.
- If there are any questions, ask.

if more tables need to be created, or even modified from the examples I provided, that's okay. That was meant to be more of a reference of how it may be simplfified from the original example. The one thing we do not want to do is create
a bunch of teblaes and columns, unneccesarily, when we may be able to accomplish the same concept with less, more organized tables and schemas. Use the _type tables and _map as examples of creating flexiblitiy, scalalibity, auditaiblity,
and very clear main "entity" tables like policy, program, entity, communication, etc..

- Output your response in the same approaches directory in a seperate file.
