* We are going to generate our Accounting Global Requirements for the personal auto insurance system.
  * Aime/workspace/requirements/GlobalRequirements/IndividualRequirements
    * The Accounting Global Requirements will need to align with and accompany the other Global Requirements for this system.
  * Aime/workspace/requirements/Accounting/Documentation
    * This directory holds documentation and things to keep in mind when coming up with the global requirements
  
Reference these files and directories for existing source code, decisions, models, etc.. for structure, archictecture, and anything else that will help in generating these requirements.
  * Aime/workspace/requirements/ProducerPortal/architectural-decisions.md
  * Aime/workspace/requirements/ProducerPortal/entity-catalog.md
  * Aime/workspace/requirements/ProducerPortal/CLAUDE.md
  * Aime/workspace/requirements/CLAUDE.md
  * Aime/workspace/blitzy-requirements

In Aime/workspace/requirements/Accounting/output
* generate a plan document
  * review all Aime/workspace/requirements/Accounting/Documentation to get a sense of what we're trying to accomplish
  * take all supporting sources files and directories to see what's already available vs what needs to be net new.
  * ask any questions you may have that could clarify anything or provide direction.
  * If there are decisions to be made on how to structure models, business logic, communication protoal, etc.. present them in this file as well.
  * Provide your suggested way to handle the accounting infrastructure with eveyrthing in mind.
