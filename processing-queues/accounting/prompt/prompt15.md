Take the requirements in Aime/workspace/requirements/processing-queues/accounting/pending/accounting-global-requirements-generation-v10.md
- Use the process in Aime/workspace/requirements/README.md
- create a -tech-plan file that accompanies the requirement file.
  - Tech plan should include just the tables and schemas that would support the requirements outlined.
  - tech plan should also outline anything else that would make for a great technical requirements document, minus the actual laravel code.
