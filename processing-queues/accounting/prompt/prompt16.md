Below is an example of a "simplified" way of handling the accounting requirements when it comes to the database.
Although this may not cover everything outlined in the existing accounting requirements in Aime/workspace/requirements/processing-queues/accounting/pending/accounting-global-requirements-generation-v10.md, it appears to be much more manageable than the proposition in Aime/workspace/requirements/processing-queues/accounting/pending/accounting-global-requirements-generation-v10-tech-plan.md.
- Re-evaluate the accoutning requirements, stressing simplicity over sophistication and see what you come up with.
- Use the process outlined in README.md
