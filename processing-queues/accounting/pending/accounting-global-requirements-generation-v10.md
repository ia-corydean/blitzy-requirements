# Accounting Global Requirements Generation - Version 10 (Enhanced Clarity)

## Executive Summary

Version 10 refines the accounting requirements by incorporating detailed reinstatement and endorsement processes, clarifying payment requirements, and addressing all stakeholder questions. The system maintains its foundation on transaction and transaction_line tables while ensuring full minimum down payment requirements and program-configurable business rules. External system integrations are designed for future readiness rather than immediate implementation, maintaining flexibility for growth.

## Core Business Principles

### 1. Equity-Based Accounting System
- Every financial transaction must maintain the fundamental accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Equity
- All business events must generate balanced journal entries with equal debits and credits
- No single-entry shortcuts or unbalanced transactions permitted
- Complete audit trail from business event to financial impact

### 2. Program-Centric Configuration
- Each insurance program defines its own financial rules and configurations
- Payment plans, fee structures, and commission rates are program-specific
- Grace periods are program-configurable (not fixed at 11/12 days)
- Small refund thresholds are program-configurable
- Business rules must be configurable without code changes
- Self-service administration for program managers

### 3. Zero Sensitive Data Storage
- No credit card numbers or bank account details stored in our database
- All payment methods represented by Paysafe tokens
- Payment data secured by Paysafe's PCI-certified infrastructure
- Only tokens and non-sensitive metadata retained locally

### 4. Audit-First Design
- Every financial transaction must be traceable to its originating business event
- Permanent retention of all financial calculations for bound policies
- 7-year historical retention for all financial transactions
- Complete transparency in premium calculations and fee applications
- Real-time financial reporting without batch processing dependencies

### 5. Modular and Extensible
- New fee types, adjustment reasons, and payment methods through configuration
- Flexible API interface for future payment gateway connections
- Extensible proof rules and document requirements
- Support for future payment innovations through gateway abstraction
- Internal system architecture ready for future external integrations

## Functional Requirements

### Transaction Management

#### Core Transaction Requirements
- Support for all insurance business events: quotes, bindings, endorsements, cancellations, reinstatements
- Transaction types must include: PREMIUM, FEE, COMMISSION, PAYMENT, ADJUSTMENT, REFUND
- Each transaction must capture the complete context of the business event
- Transactions must be immutable once created (no edits, only adjustments)

#### Transaction Components

- **Direct Transmission**: Data sent directly to Paysafe, bypassing our servers
- **Token Reception**: Paysafe returns unique tokens representing payment methods
- **Local Storage**: Only tokens and non-sensitive metadata stored in our system
- **Payment Processing**: All transactions use tokens through Paysafe's API

#### Payment Method Support
The system must support multiple payment methods through Paysafe tokenization:
- **Credit Card**: Real-time processing with zero-dollar authorization
- **ACH (Insured E-Check)**: Electronic check processing with bank validation
- **Agent E-Check (Sweep)**: Agency account sweep payments (batch-capable during outages)
- **Mailed-In Payment**: Physical check and money order processing (single check posting only)

#### What We Store Locally
- Paysafe token (unique identifier)

##### Payment Allocation for Sufficient Payments
When payment equals or exceeds the billed invoice amount:
1. Apply payment to the billed unsatisfied invoice
2. If payment exceeds invoice amount:

   - Recalculate all future bills based on new balance
   - System may eliminate final installments if overpayment is sufficient

##### Payment Processing Rules

- **No Backdating**: Coverage cannot be backdated to cancellation date

#### Premium Recalculation Process
1. Calculate daily premium rate: Total Premium รท Total Term Days
2. Determine remaining days: Reinstatement Date to Policy Expiration
3. Calculate remaining premium: Daily Premium ร Remaining Days
4. Add unpaid premium from before cancellation
5. Add applicable fees (reinstatement fee, installment fees)
6. Subtract any payments previously collected

#### Installment Adjustment Rules
