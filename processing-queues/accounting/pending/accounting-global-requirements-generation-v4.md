# Accounting Global Requirements Generation - Version 4 (Program Manager Integration)

## Executive Summary

This version 4 document represents a significant evolution of the accounting requirements, incorporating deep integration with the Program Manager module. The analysis reveals that Program Manager is not just a configuration system but the **financial control center** that drives virtually all accounting calculations, fee structures, commission rules, and payment configurations. This integration requires fundamental changes to our accounting approach to ensure all financial operations respect program-specific configurations.

## Pre-Analysis Summary

### Key Program Manager Components Affecting Accounting

1. **Financial Configuration Elements**
   - **Payment Plans**: Full Pay, Installment with configurable down payment percentages (20-50%)
   - **Fee Structure**: MGA fees, MVCPA fees, convenience fees, installment fees (complex formula), NSF fees, endorsement fees, SR-22 fees
   - **Commission Structure**: New business rates, renewal rates, calculation basis (Collected/Earned/Written), term-specific rates, producer overrides
   - **Sales Tax Configuration**: State-specific tax rates and application rules
   - **Cancellation Methods**: Pro Rata vs Short Rate with configurable lead times

2. **Rate Calculation Components**
   - Base rates per coverage line with term applicability
   - Individual rating factors (payment options, EFT, driver points, etc.)
   - Factor groupings (lienholder + vehicle count, policy core matrix, etc.)
   - Territory factors at ZIP code level
   - Payment method acceptance factors
   - **Critical**: Rating order affects final premium - fees ALWAYS applied last

3. **Integration Requirements**
   - **Payment Processor**: Paysafe/Tranzpay integration
   - **Positive Pay**: Sunflower Bank integration
   - **Agency Management System**: APIs for commission tracking and producer management

## Major Changes from Version 2

### 1. Program-Centric Architecture
All accounting operations must now reference Program Manager configurations:
- Premium calculations use program-specific rate factors and base rates
- Fee applications follow program-defined formulas and stacking rules
- Commission calculations vary by program, product line, and producer tier
- Payment plans are dynamically generated from program configurations

### 2. Enhanced Commission Management
Program Manager reveals commission complexity not addressed in v2:
- **Calculation Basis Options**: Collected (when payment received), Earned (over policy term), Written (at bind)
- **Tiered Commission Structures**: Agency tier affects commission rates
- **Commission Caps**: Maximum commission amounts per policy
- **Producer Overrides**: Program defaults can be overridden at producer level

### 3. Complex Fee Calculation Engine
The installment fee formula from Program Manager requires sophisticated calculation:
```
Installment Fee = Base Fee + ceil((Term Premium - Base Threshold) / Increment Amount) Ã— Increment Fee
```

### 4. Payment Plan Flexibility
Program Manager defines payment plans with:
- Variable down payment percentages (not fixed at 20%)
- Different installment counts (not just monthly/quarterly)
- Plan-specific factors affecting premium
- EFT enhancement discounts

### 5. Territory-Based Financial Calculations
ZIP code level territory factors affect:
- Base premium calculations
- Coverage-specific adjustments
- Term-specific variations

## Critical Questions Requiring Clarification

### Program Manager Integration

1. **Rate Change Handling**
   - How do mid-term program rate changes affect in-force policies?
     - Rate changes only go into affect on new business and renewals.
   - Should we recalculate or grandfather existing policies?
     - Existing polcies will renew into the newer rate chart.
   - What triggers a re-rating event?
     - An endorsement, renewal, changes during rate quote bind,

2. **Commission Timing**
   - For EARNED basis, what's the exact earning schedule (daily, monthly)?
     - monthly.
   - How do cancellations affect earned but unpaid commissions?
     - Suggestion?
   - Do short-rate cancellations affect commission differently than pro-rata?
     - Explain?

3. **Fee Stacking**
   - What's the complete order for multiple fee types?
     - scour through all the information in this directory for the answer.
     - Aime/workspace/requirements/ProgramManager/Documentation
   - Can certain fees be combined (e.g., convenience + installment)?
     - See the program rating requirements
   - How do fee waivers affect stacking order?
     - Explain?

4. **Territory Changes**
   - How do territory factor changes affect existing policies?
     - Existing policies are not changed by a rate change, but endorsements.
     - Remeber, upon binding a policy, that is a legal contract for a period of time.
   - Is re-rating automatic or manual for territory changes?
     - automatic upon renewal.
   - How do we handle policies that span territory changes?
     - it should be evaluated upon renewal.

### Payment Plan Modifications

1. **Plan Change Rules**
   - Can payment plans be changed mid-term?
     - Technically, yes. However, not necessarily by a payment plan selection.
       - Given that the system is equity based, if a payment is made over the invoiced amount, the remaining premium should be automatically redistributed accross the remaining payment fo the term.
         - In some cases, this could remove a payment at the end of the term, which would in essence be chnaging the payment plan.
     - They can also change the due date.
   - How do plan changes affect installment fees?
     - Goven my response above, is this still a question?
   - What validates a plan modification request?
     - See my answer above.

2. **EFT Discount Application**
   - When is EFT discount locked in?
     - Whenever they choose to add it.
   - Can EFT discount be removed mid-term?
     - Yes, via endorsement.
   - How does EFT failure affect the discount?
     - Failures should be logged and possible a suspense added for the underwrtiting team to review.

### Audit and Compliance

1. **Calculation Transparency**
   - What level of detail needed for rate calculation logs?
     - Everything from steps in the process, premium, fees, rate order of caluclation, actual calculations, etcc.
       - An auditor should be able to look at this and know exactly how a policy was rated to a specfifc program.
   - How long must calculation audit trails be retained?
     - Forever on bound policies and endorsements.
   - What format for regulatory reporting?
     - Suggestions?

2. **Program Version Control**
   - How do we handle policies spanning multiple program versions?
     - An offer to renew is sent out to the insured to renew. The reweal will be based on the rates of the newer version of the existing chart.
   - What constitutes a major vs minor program change?
     - Program changes are all major as they affect all policies written under them.
   - How do we audit program version usage?
      - scour through all the information in this directory for the answer.
      - Aime/workspace/requirements/ProgramManager/Documentation

## Conclusion

This Version 4 document represents a fundamental shift in how accounting integrates with the insurance platform. The Program Manager is revealed as the financial brain of the system, requiring tight integration and careful attention to configuration-driven calculations. The enhanced requirements ensure that accounting respects all program rules while maintaining the audit trail and flexibility needed for insurance operations.

The key insight is that accounting cannot be treated as a standalone domain - it must be deeply integrated with Program Manager configurations to ensure accurate financial calculations and compliance with business rules.
