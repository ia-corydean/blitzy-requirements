# Accounting Global Requirements Generation - Version 7 (Business Requirements)

## Executive Summary

Version 7 presents the accounting requirements as pure business specifications, focusing on WHAT the system must accomplish rather than HOW it will be implemented. The accounting system serves as the financial foundation for the insurance platform, built on the principle of equity-based double-entry bookkeeping with complete audit transparency.

## Core Business Principles

### 1. Equity-Based Accounting System

- All business events must generate balanced journal entries with equal debits and credits
- No single-entry shortcuts or unbalanced transactions permitted
- Complete audit trail from business event to financial impact

### 2. Program-Centric Configuration
- Each insurance program defines its own financial rules and configurations
- Payment plans, fee structures, and commission rates are program-specific
- Business rules must be configurable without code changes
- Self-service administration for program managers

### 3. Audit-First Design
- Every financial transaction must be traceable to its originating business event
- Permanent retention of all financial calculations for bound policies
- Complete transparency in premium calculations and fee applications
- Real-time financial reporting without batch processing dependencies

### 4. Modular and Extensible
- New fee types, adjustment reasons, and payment methods through configuration
- Flexible commission structures supporting various calculation bases
- Extensible proof rules and document requirements
- Gateway integration flexibility for payment processors
