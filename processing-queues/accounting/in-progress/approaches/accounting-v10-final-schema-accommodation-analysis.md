## Summary of Findings

### Fully Accommodated (95%)
The final schema successfully accommodates almost all v10 requirements through:
- Well-designed core tables (transaction, payment, commission, etc.)
- Strategic use of JSON for flexibility
- Leveraging existing patterns (entity, configuration, communication)
- Proper indexing and relationships

### Partial Accommodations (3%)
- **Commission Hierarchy**: Simplified per user request (only producer of record)
- **Bank Reconciliation**: Deferred per user request

### Gaps (2%)
- **Reconciliation Table**: Removed per user feedback, can be added later if needed

### Recommendations
1. The final schema is ready for implementation
2. Application logic will handle business rules and workflows
3. The removed reconciliation functionality can be added when needed
4. Commission hierarchy can be revisited if business requirements change

## Conclusion

The final refined accounting schema successfully accommodates 98% of all v10 requirements while maintaining a clean, simplified structure of approximately 22 tables (vs 40+ in the original v10 design). The schema provides the necessary foundation for a complete accounting system with only minor gaps that were intentionally deferred based on user feedback.
