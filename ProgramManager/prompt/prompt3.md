Analyze the rate factors defined in Aime/workspace/requirements/ProgramManager/Documentation
* These factors support the program defined in Aime/workspace/requirements/GlobalRequirements/IndividualRequirements/63-aguila-dorada-program-traits.md
* Create a full interpritation of those factors and rating guidlelines and create a summary in Aime/workspace/requirements/ProgramManager/output
    * If you have any questions for clarity, ask.
    * this interpritation should match in format what you have in 63-aguila-dorada-program-traits.md

     Create Individual Rate Factor Interpretation Files                                                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
     Task: Analyze each rate factor file in /app/workspace/requirements/ProgramManager/Documentation/Rate Factors and create a separate interpretation document for each one.                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
     Deliverable: Create individual files in /app/workspace/requirements/ProgramManager/output, one for each rate factor:

     Format: Each file will match the structure of 63-aguila-dorada-program-traits.md:
     - Header with specific rate factor title
     - Overview section explaining the factor's purpose
     - Numbered sections with detailed specifications
     - Factual documentation of what each rate factor file contains
     - Same formatting style as GR-63

     Content: Pure interpretation of each individual rate factor as it exists in the HTML files.
