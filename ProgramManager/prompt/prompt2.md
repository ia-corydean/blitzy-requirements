* create a alignment-analysis2.md file with:
  * outline in a more distinct fashion what changes should be made in GR-63 vs rate-factors-summary.md
    * rate-factors-summary.md will represent how our rating will ultamtley behave based on our decisions - not how it's necessaily defined now.
    * GR-63 should align in specs with rate-factors-summary.md as it represent the actual program.
* create another rate-factors-summary.md with:
  * our decisions made from alignment-analysis.md
  * This should give a full outline in how rating works, what each factor is, how it should be calulated, things to keep in mind, etc..
    * If I were a Stakeholder or an AI agent, I need to be able to fully understand rating that aligns with the program defined in GR-63
