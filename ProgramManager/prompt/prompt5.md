In Aime/workspace/requirements/ProgramManager/Documentation/PrelimRequirements
- There are multiple files that outline the proposed program manager module, functionality, etc..
- Some of these files are not formatted well, so do your best to read them.
  - If you need to update / modify a file, just create a new one instead so I can review the difference.
- This flow is how we would handle and setup all system programs as well as rate changes.
- Learn as much as you can about this process and provide an intitial requirements file in processing-queues/program-manager/pending that I can review for approval before we run it through the process defined in Aime/workspace/requirements/README.md
