For each factor in Aime/workspace/requirements/ProgramManager/Factors
* create another -plan file in Aime/workspace/requirements/ProgramManager/Factors/Plan
  * The plan file will be where we iterate to approve what our global requirements are going to be for each factor.
  * we need to ensure we account for tabled and schemas needed to support each as well as everything esle we would expect to see in our Global Requirements.

Reference these files and directories for existing source code, decisions, models, etc.. for structure, archictecture, and anything else that will help in generating these requirements.
