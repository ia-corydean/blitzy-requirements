## 2. Coverage Definition and Scope

### Additional Equipment Coverage Overview
**Coverage Description:**
- **Coverage Basis**: Stated amount insurance for additional equipment
- **Physical Damage Extension**: Comprehensive and Collision coverage for additional equipment
- **Eligible Vehicles**: Panel trucks, pickup trucks, and vans with physical damage coverage
- **Endorsement Requirement**: Requires additional equipment coverage endorsement

### Coverage Purpose
**Equipment Protection:**

## 3. Eligibility Requirements

### Vehicle Type Eligibility
**Qualifying Vehicles:**
- **Panel Trucks**: Commercial panel trucks with physical damage coverage
- **Pickup Trucks**: Pickup trucks with comprehensive and/or collision coverage
- **Vans**: Vans with existing physical damage coverage
- **Physical Damage Requirement**: Must have comprehensive and/or collision coverage

### Coverage Prerequisites
**Required Base Coverage:**
- **Physical Damage Coverage**: Must have comprehensive and/or collision coverage
- **Corresponding Coverage**: AEC requires matching physical damage coverage types
- **Coverage Dependency**: Cannot purchase AEC without underlying physical damage protection

## 4. Coverage Limits and Structure

### Coverage Limit Options
**Stated Amount Limits:**
- **Minimum Limit**: $100
- **Maximum Limit**: $3,000
- **Increment Structure**: Available in $100 increments
- **Limit Selection**: Customer selects specific stated amount within range

### Coverage Amount Examples
**Available Limits:**
- **$100 to $3,000**: In $100 increments ($100, $200, $300, ..., $3,000)

## 5. Premium Calculation Methodology

### Base Rate Structure
**Rating Formula:**
- **Base Calculation**: ((AEC Limit ÷ 100) × Base Rate) × Payment Plan × Term = Premium
- **AEC Base Rate**: Specific base rate for additional equipment coverage
- **Limit Factor**: AEC limit divided by 100 creates multiplication factor
- **Additional Factors**: Payment plan and term factors apply to final calculation

### Premium Calculation Examples
**Sample Calculations:**

#### $1,000 AEC Limit Example
- **Limit Factor**: $1,000 ÷ 100 = 10
- **Base Calculation**: 10 × AEC Base Rate
- **Final Premium**: Base calculation × Payment Plan × Term factors

#### $3,000 AEC Limit Example
- **Limit Factor**: $3,000 ÷ 100 = 30
- **Base Calculation**: 30 × AEC Base Rate  
- **Final Premium**: Base calculation × Payment Plan × Term factors

## 6. Business Rules and Restrictions

### Vehicle Rating Rules
**Rating Considerations:**
1. **Symbol Determination**: Additional equipment cost NOT considered when determining vehicle symbol
2. **Customizing Charge**: The AEC charge is the ONLY charge for additional equipment on vehicle
3. **Equipment Exclusion**: Equipment value excluded from base vehicle rating

### Coverage Application Rules
**Application Requirements:**
- **Declarations Page**: AEC stated amount appears on policy declarations
- **Matching Coverage**: Must have corresponding comprehensive or collision coverage
- **Deductible Consistency**: AEC deductibles match comprehensive and collision deductibles

## 7. Deductible Requirements

### Deductible Structure
**Deductible Rules:**
- **Matching Requirement**: AEC deductibles shall be same as comprehensive and collision deductibles
- **Consistency Requirement**: Cannot have different deductibles for AEC vs. underlying coverage
- **Coverage Alignment**: Deductible structure aligns with base physical damage coverage

### Deductible Application
**Coverage Coordination:**
- **Comprehensive Alignment**: AEC comprehensive claims use same deductible as base comprehensive
- **Collision Alignment**: AEC collision claims use same deductible as base collision  
- **No Separate Deductible**: AEC does not have independent deductible options

## 8. Coverage Integration

### Physical Damage Coverage Relationship
**Coverage Dependencies:**
- **Base Coverage Required**: AEC requires underlying comprehensive and/or collision coverage
- **Coverage Matching**: AEC coverage type must match available base coverage
- **Coordinated Claims**: AEC claims coordinate with base physical damage coverage

### Endorsement Requirements
**Policy Documentation:**
- **Endorsement Addition**: AEC requires specific policy endorsement
- **Coverage Documentation**: Endorsement defines extent of additional equipment coverage
- **Policy Integration**: AEC coverage integrated into overall policy structure

## 9. System Implementation

### Data Requirements
- **Vehicle Type Validation**: System validation of eligible vehicle types (panel truck, pickup, van)
- **Coverage Dependency**: Verification of required physical damage coverage
- **Limit Options**: Available limit options from $100 to $3,000 in $100 increments
- **Rate Calculation**: AEC base rate and calculation formula implementation

### Processing Requirements
1. **Eligibility Verification**: Confirm vehicle type and existing physical damage coverage
2. **Limit Selection**: Customer selection of AEC stated amount within available range
3. **Premium Calculation**: Application of AEC rating formula
4. **Deductible Coordination**: Automatic alignment of AEC deductibles with base coverage
5. **Endorsement Processing**: Addition of AEC endorsement to policy

## 10. Quality Controls

### Validation Procedures
- **Vehicle Eligibility**: Verify vehicle qualifies for AEC coverage
- **Coverage Prerequisites**: Confirm required physical damage coverage exists
- **Limit Validation**: Ensure selected limit within allowable range and increments
- **Deductible Consistency**: Validate AEC deductibles match base coverage deductibles
- **Rating Accuracy**: Verify correct application of AEC rating formula

### Exception Handling
- **Ineligible Vehicles**: Process for handling AEC requests on ineligible vehicle types
- **Missing Base Coverage**: Procedures when required physical damage coverage absent
- **Invalid Limits**: Handling of AEC limit selections outside allowed parameters
- **System Errors**: Error handling for AEC rating calculation failures
