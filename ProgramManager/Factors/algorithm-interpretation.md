# Algorithm Rate Factor Interpretation
## Aguila Dorada Texas Personal Auto Program

### Overview
This document provides the complete factual interpretation of the Algorithm rate factor for the Aguila Dorada Texas Personal Auto insurance program. This serves as the definitive reference for understanding the core rating calculation methodology and multiplicative approach used in premium determination.

## 1. Algorithm Identification

### Factor Details
- **Factor Name**: Algorithm
- **Company**: Old American County Mutual
- **Managing General Agency**: Aguila Dorada
- **Program**: Private Passenger Auto
- **Effective Date**: New Business 07/15/2025, Renewal 08/15/2025
- **System**: New System Implementation

## 2. Core Rating Methodology

### Multiplicative Algorithm Structure
The rating algorithm uses a **multiplicative approach** where all rating factors are multiplied together to determine the final premium:

```
Final Premium = Base Rate × Policy Core Matrix × Driver Class × Vehicle Factors × Coverage Factors × Miscellaneous Adjustments
```

### Calculation Sequence
1. **Base Rate Selection**: Territory-based base rates by coverage type
2. **Policy Core Matrix Application**: Three-dimensional discount matrix
3. **Driver Classification**: Age, gender, marital status factors
4. **Driver Points**: Violation and conviction multipliers
5. **Vehicle Factors**: Age, use, make/model adjustments
6. **Coverage Limits**: Liability and physical damage limit factors
7. **Miscellaneous Adjustments**: Policy-level discounts and surcharges

## 3. Rating Factor Categories

### Primary Rating Components
1. **Base Rates**: Foundation premium by territory and coverage
2. **Core Matrix**: Prior insurance, years licensed, ownership combination
3. **Driver Factors**: Demographic and driving record characteristics
4. **Vehicle Factors**: Physical and usage characteristics
5. **Coverage Factors**: Limit and deductible selections
6. **Policy Adjustments**: Discounts and operational factors

### Factor Interaction Rules
- **All factors multiply**: No additive components in core rating
- **Compound effect**: Multiple risk factors create exponential impact
- **Minimum floor**: System prevents premiums below operational minimums
- **Maximum caps**: Individual factors may have maximum values

## 4. Calculation Methodology

### Step-by-Step Process
1. **Territory Lookup**: Determine base rates by ZIP code territory
2. **Matrix Calculation**: Apply three-dimensional core matrix discount
3. **Driver Rating**: Calculate each driver's individual factors
4. **Vehicle Rating**: Apply vehicle-specific multipliers
5. **Coverage Rating**: Adjust for selected limits and deductibles
6. **Final Adjustments**: Apply policy-level modifications

### Mathematical Approach
- **Multiplicative Only**: All factors use multiplication, not addition
- **Decimal Precision**: Factors calculated to three decimal places
- **Rounding Rules**: Final premium rounded to nearest dollar
- **Minimum Premium**: Operational minimum enforced after all calculations

## 5. Rate Factor Integration

### Core Dependencies
1. **Territory Assignment**: Must be established before base rate selection
2. **Coverage Selection**: Required before limit factors can be applied
3. **Driver Assignment**: Necessary for proper driver factor application
4. **Vehicle Classification**: Required for accurate vehicle factor determination

### Validation Requirements
- **Factor Completeness**: All required factors must have values
- **Range Validation**: Each factor must fall within acceptable ranges
- **Logical Consistency**: Factor combinations must be operationally valid
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Final rates must meet state requirements

## 6. System Implementation

### Rating Engine Requirements
1. **Real-Time Processing**: Instantaneous factor lookup and calculation
2. **Factor Storage**: Efficient storage of all rate factor tables
3. **Calculation Audit**: Complete tracking of all applied factors
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing or invalid factors

### Performance Standards
- **Calculation Speed**: Complete rating in under 2 seconds
- **Accuracy Requirements**: 99.9% calculation accuracy
- **Consistency**: Identical inputs produce identical results
- **Scalability**: Support for high-volume concurrent calculations

## 7. Quality Controls

### Validation Checks
1. **Factor Range Validation**: Ensure all factors within acceptable bounds
2. **Combination Logic**: Verify valid factor combinations
3. **Result Reasonableness**: Check final premium reasonableness
4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Confirm compliance with state regulations

### Audit Requirements
- **Calculation Tracking**: Complete audit trail of applied factors
- **Version Control**: Track rate factor version usage
- **Exception Logging**: Record any calculation anomalies
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track calculation performance metrics

## 8. Business Rules

### Hard Rules (System Enforced)
- **Multiplicative Only**: No deviation from multiplication approach
- **Factor Completeness**: All factors must be present for valid rating
- **Minimum Premium**: Operational minimum premium enforcement
- **Regulatory Limits**: Maximum allowable factor ranges

### Operational Guidelines
- **Factor Updates**: Systematic approach to rate factor changes
- **Testing Requirements**: Comprehensive testing of algorithm changes
- **Documentation**: Complete documentation of all factor relationships
- **Training**: Ensure staff understanding of multiplicative approach
