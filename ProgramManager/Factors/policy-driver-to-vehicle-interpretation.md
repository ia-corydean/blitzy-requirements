## 3. Coverage-Specific Impact Analysis

### Liability Coverage (BI/PD)
**Impact Pattern:**
- Factors range from 0.950 to 1.400
- Higher driver-to-vehicle ratios increase liability risk
- Multiple drivers on single vehicle creates highest risk (1.400 factor)
- Single driver with multiple vehicles provides discount (0.950 factor)

### Uninsured Motorist Coverage (UMBI/UMPD)
**Impact Pattern:**
- All factors remain 1.000 (no adjustment)
- Driver-to-vehicle ratio does not affect UM coverage risk
- Consistent factor across all household configurations

### Medical Coverage (MED/PIP)
**Impact Pattern:**
- All factors remain 1.000 (no adjustment)
- Driver-to-vehicle ratio does not affect medical coverage risk
- Consistent factor across all household configurations

### Physical Damage Coverage (COMP/COLL)
**Impact Pattern:**
- Factors range from 0.950 to 1.400
- Mirrors liability coverage patterns
- Higher driver counts increase physical damage risk
- Multiple vehicles with fewer drivers provide discounts

## 4. Risk Assessment Methodology

### High-Risk Configurations
**Multiple Drivers, Single Vehicle:**
- 4+ drivers, 1 vehicle: 1.400 factor (40% surcharge)
- 3 drivers, 1 vehicle: 1.200 factor (20% surcharge)
- **Risk Basis**: Multiple operators increase accident probability

**Unbalanced Ratios:**
- 1 driver, 3+ vehicles: 1.100 factor (10% surcharge)
- 2 drivers, 4+ vehicles: 1.100 factor (10% surcharge)
- **Risk Basis**: Insufficient driver attention to vehicle maintenance and operation

### Low-Risk Configurations
**Balanced Ratios:**
- 2 drivers, 2 vehicles: 1.000 factor (base rate)
- 3 drivers, 3 vehicles: 1.000 factor (base rate)
- 4+ drivers, 4+ vehicles: 1.000 factor (base rate)

**Favorable Ratios:**
- 1 driver, 2 vehicles: 0.950 factor (5% discount)
- 2 drivers, 3 vehicles: 0.995 factor (minimal discount)
- 3 drivers, 4+ vehicles: 0.950 factor (5% discount)

## 5. Business Rules

### Driver and Vehicle Counting
**Driver Counting Rules:**
- All licensed household members count as drivers
- Excluded drivers do not count toward driver total
- Unlisted drivers count toward driver total
- Age restrictions apply (drivers over 75 excluded)

**Vehicle Counting Rules:**
- All covered vehicles count toward vehicle total
- Excluded vehicles do not count
- Temporary vehicles count when covered
- Recreational vehicles may be excluded from count

### Factor Application
- **Policy Level**: Factor applies at policy level, not per vehicle
- **All Vehicles**: Same factor applies to all vehicles on policy
- **Coverage Specific**: Different factors for different coverage types
- **Calculation Timing**: Factor calculated at policy inception and renewal

## 6. System Implementation

### Data Requirements
- **Household Composition**: Complete driver and vehicle counts
- **Factor Matrix**: Complete matrix of all driver/vehicle combinations
- **Validation Rules**: Rules for counting drivers and vehicles
- **Exception Handling**: Process for unusual household configurations

### Processing Requirements
1. **Count Calculation**: Automatic calculation of driver and vehicle counts
2. **Factor Lookup**: Automatic factor selection based on counts
3. **Factor Application**: Application of factors to appropriate coverages
4. **Validation**: Verification of accurate counts and factor application

## 7. Quality Controls

### Validation Procedures
- **Count Accuracy**: Verify accurate driver and vehicle counts
- **Factor Selection**: Confirm correct factor selected for household configuration
- **Coverage Application**: Ensure factors applied to correct coverages only
- **Calculation Verification**: Validate mathematical accuracy of factor application

### Exception Handling
- **Large Households**: Process for households exceeding normal parameters

- **Count Disputes**: Resolution process for driver/vehicle count disagreements
- **System Errors**: Error handling for factor lookup failures

## 8. Multi-Car Discount Considerations

### Traditional Multi-Car Benefits
- **Physical Discounts**: Some configurations provide automatic discounts
- **Balanced Households**: Optimal ratios receive favorable factors
- **Large Fleet Benefits**: Multiple vehicles with adequate drivers

### Risk-Based Adjustments
- **Overloaded Vehicles**: Penalties for too many drivers per vehicle
- **Underutilized Fleets**: Surcharges for excess vehicles relative to drivers
- **Optimal Configurations**: Rewards for balanced driver-to-vehicle ratios
