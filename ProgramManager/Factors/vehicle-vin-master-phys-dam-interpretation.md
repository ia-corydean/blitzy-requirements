# Vehicle VIN Master Physical Damage Rate Factor Interpretation
## Aguila Dorada Texas Personal Auto Program

### Overview
This document provides the complete factual interpretation of the Vehicle VIN Master Physical Damage rate factor for the Aguila Dorada Texas Personal Auto insurance program. This factor establishes comprehensive physical damage symbol assignments based on VIN Master data or vehicle cost when VIN Master symbols are unavailable, with different rating structures for vehicles model year 2010 and prior versus 2011 and newer.

## 1. Factor Identification

### Factor Details
- **Factor Name**: Vehicle VIN Master Physical Damage Symbol Factors
- **Company**: Old American County Mutual
- **Managing General Agency**: Aguila Dorada
- **Program**: Private Passenger Auto
- **Effective Date**: New Business 07/15/2025, Renewal 08/15/2025
- **System**: New System Implementation
- **Maximum Cost New**: $80,000 allowable limit

## 2. Factor Structure and Definitions

### Coverage Applications
The factor applies to three physical damage coverage types:
- **COMP** (Comprehensive)
- **COLL** (Collision)
- **UMPD** (Uninsured Motorist Property Damage)

### VIN Master Symbol Hierarchy
1. **Primary Assignment**: Use VIN Master symbol if available
2. **Secondary Assignment**: Use VIN Master symbol from prior model year of same vehicle
3. **Tertiary Assignment**: Assign symbol based on Cost New using factor tables

### Model Year Classifications

#### Model Year 2010 and Prior
**Symbol Range**: 1-20 with selective assignments
**Factor Structure**: Separate multipliers for COMP and COLL/UMPD

#### Model Year 2011 and Newer  
**Symbol Range**: 1-43 with comprehensive coverage
**Factor Structure**: Unified multipliers across all physical damage coverages
**UMPD Rule**: Use COLL symbol value for UMPD coverage

## 3. Business Rules

### Symbol Assignment Logic

#### Primary VIN Master Assignment
- **First Priority**: Direct VIN Master symbol lookup
- **Vehicle Identification**: VIN-based symbol determination
- **Industry Standard**: Use established automotive industry symbols

#### Secondary Assignment (Prior Model Year)
- **Condition**: Current model year VIN Master symbol unavailable
- **Method**: Use prior model year symbol for same vehicle
- **Consistency**: Maintain symbol continuity across model years

#### Cost-Based Assignment (Fallback)
- **Trigger**: No VIN Master symbol available (current or prior year)
- **Method**: Cost New determines symbol assignment
- **Model Year Split**: Different tables for 2010 and prior vs 2011+

### Cost New Limitations
- **Maximum Allowable**: $80,000 Cost New limit
- **Overflow Handling**: Vehicles exceeding $80,000 assigned highest symbol
- **Verification**: System validation of Cost New accuracy
