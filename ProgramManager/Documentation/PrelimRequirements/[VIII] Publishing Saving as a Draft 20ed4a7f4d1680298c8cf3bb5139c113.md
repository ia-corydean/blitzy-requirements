# [VIII] Publishing/Saving as a Draft

At the final step of program creation, users are given the option to either:

### **Publish the Program**

- Makes the program available for quoting and binding at the effective date set.
- Triggers the activation of associated rate factors, coverages, limits, and claim program configuration.
- Locks historical versions for audit tracking.
- All required fields must be completed and validated.

> ⚠️ Important: If the program was saved as a draft with an effective date in the past, the date must be updated to at least the current date before it can be published.
> 

### **Save as Draft**

- Allows users to save a partially configured program for internal testing or later completion.
- Drafts are **not visible to downstream systems** (quote, bind, claims).
- Programs in draft mode can still use:
    - The **Rate Tester**
    - Scenario-based quoting
    - Internal reviews and edits
- A program can be published only once all **required sections are validated**.
