# Requirements Generation Standards

## Complete Architecture Integration

### Repository Structure
- **Global Requirements**: `/app/workspace/requirements/GlobalRequirements/IndividualRequirements/`
- **Domain-Specific Standards**: `/app/workspace/requirements/[Domain]/CLAUDE.md`
- **Approved Requirements**: `/app/workspace/requirements/[Domain]/approved-requirements/`
- **Infrastructure Codebase**: `/app/workspace/blitzy-requirements/` (staging branch)

### Cross-Reference Standards
Every requirement must verify against:
1. Applicable Global Requirements
2. Domain-specific approved requirements  
3. Existing infrastructure patterns
4. Current codebase implementations

### Infrastructure Integration

#### Repository Access Procedures
Before processing any requirement:
```bash
cd /app/workspace/blitzy-requirements
git checkout staging
git pull origin staging
```

**GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/blitzy-public-samples/insure-pilot-new/tree/staging

#### Infrastructure Reference Guidelines
1. **Read-Only Access**: NEVER modify any files in blitzy-requirements
2. **Pattern Discovery**: Search for existing implementations before creating new patterns
3. **Validation**: Cross-reference all new requirements against existing code
4. **Documentation**: Note which parts of blitzy-requirements implement similar features

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: The blitzy-requirements directory contains active development code. Any modifications could break the production system. This directory is for REFERENCE ONLY.

#### Cross-Reference Standards
Every requirement must validate against existing infrastructure:

**Database Schema Validation:**
- Check `src/backend/database/migrations/` for existing table patterns
- Review `src/backend/app/Models/` for entity relationships
- Validate naming conventions against established patterns

**API Pattern Validation:**
- Review `src/backend/routes/api.php` and `src/backend/routes/portal_api.php`
- Check `src/backend/app/Http/Controllers/` for endpoint patterns
- Validate RESTful conventions and response formats

**Service Layer Validation:**
- Review `src/backend/app/Services/` for business logic patterns
- Check integration with external services
- Validate authentication and authorization patterns

#### Performance Benchmarks
From actual infrastructure analysis:
- Entity queries: <500ms target
- API response times: <200ms for standard operations
- Database connections: Connection pooling via Laravel

### Quality Assurance Integration
Enhanced quality gates include:
- [ ] Global Requirements compliance verified
- [ ] Approved requirements consistency confirmed
- [ ] Infrastructure patterns aligned
- [ ] Git repository currency validated

## Overview
This document serves as a high-level guide and reference aggregator, pointing to specific global requirements for detailed implementation. All detailed specifications are maintained in the GlobalRequirements/IndividualRequirements directory.

## Core Principles
- GlobalRequirements/IndividualRequirements serve as the single source of truth
- Context files translate and aggregate references for practical use
- Consistent patterns across all requirements and domains
- Each global requirement focuses on exactly one topic for clarity

## Section C Requirements (Backend Mappings)

### Format Standards
Backend mappings should use clear arrow notation for query paths:
```
get [entity].id from [table]
-> get [related_entity] by [entity].[foreign_key]
-> return [fields], [transformations]
```

### Integration Specifications
When applicable, Section C should include:

- Configuration Management patterns
- Security Implementation details
- Performance & Monitoring approach
- Error Handling strategies

## Section E Requirements (Database Schema)

### Table Organization
Group tables by type in this order:
1. Core Tables - Main business entities
2. Reference Tables - Lookup/type tables
3. Relationship Tables - map_* tables
4. Supporting Tables - Reusable entities

## Quality Checklist

### Pre-Implementation
- [ ] **Review applicable global requirements** (GR-52, GR-48, GR-44, GR-41, GR-19, GR-64)
- [ ] **Check GR-64 for reinstatement patterns** if policy lifecycle involved
- [ ] **Check SR22/SR26 filing requirements** if financial responsibility filing needed (GR-10)
- [ ] **Check domain-specific approved requirements** for reusable patterns
- [ ] **Review infrastructure codebase** for existing implementations
- [ ] **Check if entity is external** - Use universal entity pattern if so (GR-52)
- [ ] **Verify patterns align with standards** and Global Requirements
- [ ] **Check entity catalog for reuse** - Avoid creating duplicate entities
- [ ] **Confirm naming conventions** following GR-41 standards
- [ ] **Validate communication patterns** align with GR-44 if applicable
- [ ] **Review DCS integration requirements** if driver/vehicle data involved (GR-53)
- [ ] **Validate against existing API patterns** using infrastructure codebase
- [ ] **Assess database schema consistency** with current codebase

### Implementation
- [ ] **Follow template structure** → See requirement-template.md
- [ ] **Include integration specs in Section C** with Global Requirements references
- [ ] **Reference global requirements appropriately** (GR-XX format)
- [ ] **Maintain consistency with existing patterns**
- [ ] **Use universal entity management** for all external entities (APIs, attorneys, body shops, vendors)
- [ ] **Implement JSON metadata schemas** for entity types requiring UI generation
- [ ] **Apply three-level configuration hierarchy** (entity → program → system) if configuration needed
- [ ] **Use polymorphic communication tracking** with correlation IDs for external communications

### Post-Implementation
- [ ] **Update entity catalog** if new entities discovered during implementation
- [ ] **Document architectural decisions** if new patterns emerge
- [ ] **Ensure all Global Requirements references are accurate** (GR-XX format)
- [ ] **Validate against approved requirements patterns** for consistency
- [ ] **Test against infrastructure codebase** (API consistency, schema alignment)
- [ ] **Validate against performance standards** (GR-52: <500ms entity queries, <200ms communication queries)
- [ ] **Confirm compliance requirements** met (7-year retention, audit logging, PII masking)
- [ ] **Test universal entity patterns** work correctly with metadata schemas
- [ ] **Verify communication templates** function with insurance-specific helpers
- [ ] **Document infrastructure integration points** if new patterns established
- [ ] **Update approved requirements library** if new reusable patterns created
