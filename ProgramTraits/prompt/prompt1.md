Analyze the files in Aime/workspace/requirements/ProgramTraits/Documentation
* These files outline, in detail, the type of insurance program we are supporting in the all-in-one insurance platform as well as characteristics, rules, etc..

We are going to create a plan and store it Aime/workspace/requirements/ProgramTraits/output

* We are going to generate our Program Traits Global Requirements for the personal auto insurance system.
  * The Program Traits Global Requirements will need to outline, in detail, all the characteristics of the policy, program, endorsements, rules, etc.. in a way that is easy to understand but detailed enough for an ai model to read and completely understand.
  * Ask any questions you may have that could clarify anything or provide direction.

Reference these files and directories for existing source code, decisions, models, etc.. for anything else that will help in generating these requirements.
