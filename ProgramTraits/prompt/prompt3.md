In response to Aime/workspace/requirements/ProgramTraits/output/plan2.md

I have provided my feedback.

We are only generating a Global Requirement that outlines everything about this program (facts)
* Unlike other Global Requirements, the tables do not need to be in this one, as it's just for program details.
* The Requirements do need to be structured in a way that serves:
  * Claude for validating that our requirement generation is always in line with the actual program we're supporting.
  * Stakeholders to validate facts about the program details
