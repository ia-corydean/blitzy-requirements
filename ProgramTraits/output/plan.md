# Program Traits Global Requirements Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary
Based on my comprehensive analysis of the Aguila Dorada Texas Personal Auto insurance program documentation, I will create detailed Program Traits Global Requirements that provide a machine-readable specification of all program characteristics, rules, and business logic needed for the insurance platform.

## Key Program Characteristics Identified

### Program Scope
- **Aguila Dorada Texas Personal Auto** - Non-standard auto insurance product
- **Target market**: Drivers with foreign licenses, SR-22 requirements, limited prior insurance
- **Geographic scope**: Texas only
- **Policy term**: 6 months only
- **Underwriter**: Old American County Mutual (OACM)

### Coverage Framework
- **9 coverage types** with specific limits and dependencies
- **Complex coverage dependencies** (e.g., Comp/Coll must be purchased together)
- **State-mandated minimums** and rejection requirements
- **Structured deductible options** and limits

### Eligibility Matrix
- **Driver eligibility**: Age, license type, residency, conviction history rules
- **Vehicle eligibility**: Age, weight, value, use restrictions
- **Photo requirements**: 6 photos for certain coverages
- **Documentation requirements**: Various ID types and proof requirements

### Rating and Discounts
- **10 discount types** with specific qualification rules
- **Proof requirements** for each discount
- **Timing dependencies** (e.g., early shopper, prior insurance)
- **Complex interaction rules** between discounts

### Fees and Financial Structure
- **6 fee types** with specific trigger conditions
- **Payment options** with discount implications
- **Down payment structures**
- **Late fee assessments**

## Proposed Global Requirements Structure

### 63-program-traits-architecture.md
**Core program traits management system**
- Program identification and classification
- Program lifecycle management
- Configuration hierarchy (system → program → product)
- Version control and effective dating
- State-specific variations

### 64-coverage-specifications.md
**Coverage definitions and dependencies**
- Coverage type definitions and limits
- Coverage dependencies and exclusions
- Deductible structures and options
- State-mandated requirements
- Coverage combination rules

### 65-eligibility-criteria.md
**Driver and vehicle eligibility matrix**
- Driver eligibility rules (age, license, residency)
- Vehicle eligibility rules (type, age, value, use)
- Documentation requirements by scenario
- Photo requirements and specifications
- Exclusion and rejection criteria

### 66-rating-factors-discounts.md
**Rating and discount structures**
- Discount qualification rules
- Proof requirements for discounts
- Rating factor specifications
- Premium calculation sequences
- Discount interaction rules

### 67-endorsements-modifications.md
**Available endorsements and modifications**
- Endorsement definitions and purposes
- Eligibility criteria for endorsements
- Fee structures for endorsements
- Effective date rules
- Documentation requirements

### 68-fees-financial-structure.md
**Fee calculations and payment structures**
- Fee type definitions and amounts
- Assessment triggers and timing
- Payment plan structures
- Down payment calculations
- Late fee and penalty rules

### 69-business-rules-constraints.md
**Program-specific business logic**
- Underwriting guidelines
- Policy issuance rules
- Renewal criteria and restrictions
- Cancellation rules
- Exception handling procedures

## Implementation Approach

### Database Design Integration
- Leverage existing `program` table and related entities
- Extend universal entity management for program traits
- Create lookup tables for all program-specific rules
- Implement JSON metadata for complex rule structures

### Service Architecture
- `ProgramTraitsService` - Core program logic evaluation
- `EligibilityService` - Driver/vehicle eligibility checking
- `RatingService` - Premium and discount calculations
- `CoverageService` - Coverage validation and dependencies
- Integration with existing quote and policy services

### Configuration Management
- Program traits as configurable rules (not hardcoded)
- Version control for program changes
- Effective date management for rule changes
- State-specific override capabilities

### AI/ML Readiness
- Structured data format for machine learning consumption
- Clear rule hierarchies and dependencies
- Standardized validation logic
- Comprehensive test scenarios and edge cases

## Questions for Clarification

### Program Expansion
- Are there plans for additional insurance programs beyond Aguila Dorada?
  - Yes
- Should the architecture support multiple states beyond Texas?
  - Yes
- Are there variations of this program for different markets?
  - Not yet, but the system should support it.

### Rule Management
- How frequently do program rules change?
  - Monthly
- Who manages program trait updates (business users vs. developers)?
  - Business Users.
  - The ProgramManager will support doing this.
- Are there seasonal or temporary rule changes needed?
  - This is based on the end user.

### Integration Points
- How do program traits integrate with the existing quote workflow?
  - The existing quote workflow is designed to support this program and quote against it.
- Should eligibility checks be real-time or batch processed?
  - Real time.
- Are there external data sources for eligibility verification?
  - Yes. As well as driver info, vehicle info, household info, loss reporting, etc..

### Business Logic Complexity
- Should discount stacking rules be configurable or hardcoded?
  - Configurable.
- How should conflicting eligibility rules be resolved?
  - Provide an example.
- Are there tiered underwriting approval levels for exceptions?
  - Yes.

## Success Criteria

The Program Traits Global Requirements will be successful when they:
- Provide complete specification of all Aguila Dorada program rules
- Enable configuration-driven program management without code changes
- Support real-time eligibility and rating calculations
- Allow for easy addition of new programs and states
- Provide clear audit trails for all program rule applications
- Enable AI/ML systems to understand and apply program logic
- Integrate seamlessly with existing quote and policy workflows

This comprehensive approach ensures the insurance platform can handle complex program-specific logic while remaining flexible for future program additions and modifications.
