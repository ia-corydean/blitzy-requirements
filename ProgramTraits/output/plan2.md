## Example of Conflicting Eligibility Rules

To better understand conflict resolution needs, here's an example scenario:

**Scenario**: Driver eligibility conflict
- **Rule A**: "Drivers over 75 are not eligible for new business"
- **Rule B**: "Military personnel are always eligible regardless of age"
- **Conflict**: 76-year-old active military member applies for coverage

**Resolution Options Needed**:
1. **Priority-based**: Military rule takes precedence over age rule
2. **Exception-based**: Age rule applies, but military creates automatic exception request
3. **Approval-based**: Conflict triggers tiered approval workflow
4. **Combination**: Military rule allows eligibility but triggers special underwriting review

This type of conflict resolution framework needs to be configurable by business users to handle various scenarios across different programs and states.

This comprehensive approach ensures the Program Traits system will meet all requirements for scalability, configurability, and real-time performance while supporting business user management and multi-state operations.
