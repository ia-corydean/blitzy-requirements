# 42.0 System Configuration Options

1. Purpose
    1. The System Configuration Options framework is designed to provide a centralized and flexible way to manage system-wide settings. It enables dynamic configuration of key system behaviors, reducing the need for hardcoded values and allowing for easy updates without requiring system redeployment.
2. Key Responsibilities
    1. Centralized Configuration Management
        - A single source of truth for all configurable system settings stored in the configuration table.
        - Ensures consistency across all system components and services.
        - Allows for easy retrieval and updates of configuration values via API and database queries.
        - Relevant Fields:
            - configuration.id – Unique identifier for the configuration.
            - configuration.name – Name of the configuration setting.
            - configuration.value – The actual value assigned to the configuration.
            - configuration.description – Additional details explaining the configuration's purpose.
    2. Configurable Parameters
        - Supports different types of configurations, such as numeric values (e.g., range limits), boolean toggles (e.g., enable/disable features), and text-based options (e.g., predefined categories).
        - Allows for default values while enabling granular overrides at program or policy levels where needed.
        - Relevant Fields:
            - configuration_type.id – Unique identifier for the configuration type.
            - configuration_type.name – Defines the category of the configuration type (e.g., "Minimum Range Value," "Maximum Range Value," "Boolean Toggle").
            - configuration.value – The stored value, adaptable to different formats based on the configuration_type.
    3. Configuration Grouping
        - Organizes related configurations into logical groups for easier management using the configuration_group table.
        - Allows quick retrieval of all settings related to a particular function (e.g., rating rules, policy settings).
        - Relevant Fields:
            - configuration_group.id – Unique identifier for a group of configurations.
            - configuration_group.name – Name of the configuration group (e.g., "Rating Factors").
            - map_program_configuration_group.configuration_id – Maps configurations to specific programs.
            - map_policy_configuration_group.configuration_id – Maps configurations to specific policies.
    4. Tiered Configuration Levels
        - System-Level Settings: Global defaults that apply across all programs and policies.
        - Program-Level Overrides: Custom configurations tailored to specific insurance programs (map_program_configuration_group).
        - Policy-Level Overrides: Granular settings that apply to individual policies when necessary (map_policy_configuration_group).
        - Relevant Fields:
            - map_program_configuration_group.program_id – Links a configuration to a program.
            - map_policy_configuration_group.policy_id – Links a configuration to a policy.
            - configuration.value – Holds the actual setting value.
    5. Status-Based Control and Auditing
        - Supports active/inactive states for configurations to ensure controlled rollout and testing using configuration.status_id.
        - Tracks who created, modified, and last updated each configuration for auditing and compliance.
        - Relevant Fields:
            - configuration.status_id – References the status of the configuration (e.g., active, inactive).
            - configuration.created_by – Stores the user ID of the creator.
            - configuration.updated_by – Tracks the last user who updated the configuration.
            - configuration.created_at / configuration.updated_at – Timestamp fields for auditing.
3. Functional Capabilities
    1. Configuration Definition and Management
        - Admin users should be able to create, update, and deactivate configurations through a user interface.
        - Configurations should support validation rules to prevent invalid entries.
        - Relevant Fields:
            - configuration.name – Ensures unique, identifiable settings.
            - configuration.value – Must adhere to validation rules defined in configuration_type.
    2. Dynamic Configuration Retrieval
        - System components and services should be able to request configuration values dynamically via an API.
        - Responses should provide the most specific applicable setting (system, program, or policy level).
        - Relevant Fields:
            - map_program_configuration_group.configuration_id – Defines program-specific settings.
            - map_policy_configuration_group.configuration_id – Defines policy-specific overrides.
    3. Override and Hierarchical Logic
        - Policies inherit program-level configurations unless a policy-specific override is defined.
        - Programs inherit system-level defaults unless a custom setting is applied.
        - The system must correctly prioritize and apply the most relevant configuration.
        - Relevant Fields:
            - configuration.value – The stored configuration setting.
            - map_policy_configuration_group.policy_id – Overrides at the policy level.
            - map_program_configuration_group.program_id – Overrides at the program level.
    4. System and Access Control
        - Only authorized users should be able to modify configurations.
        - Audit logs should record all changes for compliance tracking.
        - Relevant Fields:
            - configuration.created_by / configuration.updated_by – Tracks changes.
            - configuration.status_id – Controls active/inactive state.
    5. Performance and Scalability
        - Configuration retrieval should be optimized for high-performance lookups.
        - The system should support caching to minimize database queries.
        - Relevant Fields:
            - configuration.value – Stored efficiently for quick lookup.
            - Indexing configuration.name, configuration_group.name, and status_id for performance optimization.
