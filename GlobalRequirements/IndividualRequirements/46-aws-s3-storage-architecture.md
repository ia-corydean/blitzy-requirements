# 46.0 AWS S3 Storage Architecture

## Hierarchical Storage Management

### Storage Tier Overview
- **Purpose**: Implement intelligent data lifecycle management with cost-optimized storage tiers
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with application services for automated data movement
- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory retention requirements while optimizing storage costs
- **Performance**: Appropriate access patterns for each data lifecycle stage

### Hot Storage (AWS S3 Standard)
- **Purpose**: Immediate access to active business data
- **Use Cases**:
  - Active insurance policies and documents
  - Current claims and supporting documentation (< 30 days)
  - Real-time document access for daily operations
  - Frequently accessed reports and analytics data
- **Performance**: Low latency, high throughput for frequent access
- **Cost Model**: Optimized for frequent access patterns

### Warm Storage (AWS S3 Intelligent-Tiering)
- **Purpose**: Automatic movement between access tiers based on usage patterns
- **Use Cases**:
  - Closed claims (6 months - 2 years)
  - Expired policies (90 days - 1 year)
  - Archived communications (30 days - 1 year)
  - Historical reports and analytics data
- **Automation**: Automatic tier transitions based on access patterns
- **Cost Optimization**: No retrieval fees, automatic cost optimization

### Cold Storage (AWS S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval)
- **Purpose**: Archive storage with occasional access requirements
- **Use Cases**:
  - Historical policies (> 1 year)
  - Settled claims (> 2 years)
  - Compliance archives (> 1 year)
  - Annual reports and historical data
- **Access Time**: Milliseconds retrieval when needed
- **Cost Model**: Lower storage cost with retrieval fees

### Archive Storage (AWS S3 Glacier Deep Archive)
- **Purpose**: Long-term retention for regulatory compliance
- **Use Cases**:
  - Legal hold documents (> 7 years)
  - Regulatory submissions (> 10 years)
  - State-mandated retention periods
  - Permanent compliance records
- **Access Time**: 12-48 hour retrieval time
- **Cost Model**: Lowest storage cost for long-term retention

## Storage Lifecycle Management

### Automated Lifecycle Policies
- **Policy Configuration**: Automated rules for data movement between tiers
- **Transition Rules**:
  - S3 Standard → Intelligent-Tiering after 30 days
  - Intelligent-Tiering → Glacier after 1 year
  - Glacier → Deep Archive after 7 years
- **Expiration Rules**: Automated deletion after retention requirements met
- **Client Customization**: Per-client lifecycle policies based on requirements

### Intelligent Tiering Configuration
- **Access Pattern Monitoring**: Automatic monitoring of object access patterns
- **Tier Transitions**:
  - Frequent Access tier: Objects accessed regularly
  - Infrequent Access tier: Objects not accessed for 30 days
  - Archive Access tier: Objects not accessed for 90 days
  - Deep Archive Access tier: Objects not accessed for 180 days
- **Cost Optimization**: Automatic optimization without performance impact

## Cross-Region Replication

### Multi-Region Architecture
- **Primary Region**: Main region for active data and operations
- **Secondary Regions**: Disaster recovery and compliance regions
- **Replication Rules**: Automatic replication of critical data
- **Compliance**: Meet data residency requirements per jurisdiction

### Replication Configuration
- **Replication Scope**:
  - All objects or filtered by prefix/tags
  - Encryption in transit and at rest
  - Replication metrics and monitoring
- **Replication Time Control**: SLA-based replication for critical data
- **Cost Management**: Selective replication based on data criticality

## Storage Security and Compliance

### Encryption Architecture
- **Encryption at Rest**: SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, or SSE-C based on requirements
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all data transfers
- **Key Management**: AWS KMS integration with customer-managed keys
- **Compliance**: HIPAA, PCI DSS, and SOX compliant encryption

### Access Control
- **Bucket Policies**: Granular access control at bucket level
- **IAM Policies**: Role-based access control for applications
- **VPC Endpoints**: Private connectivity from VPC to S3
- **Access Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail of all access

### Data Governance
- **Object Lock**: WORM (Write Once Read Many) for compliance
- **Legal Hold**: Prevent deletion of objects under legal hold
- **Versioning**: Maintain object version history
- **MFA Delete**: Additional protection for critical data deletion

## Storage Integration Patterns

### Application Integration
- **Direct Integration**: Application SDK for S3 operations
- **Pre-signed URLs**: Secure temporary access for uploads/downloads
- **S3 Transfer Acceleration**: Fast uploads from remote locations
- **Multipart Upload**: Efficient large file uploads

### Data Processing Integration
- **S3 Events**: Trigger Lambda functions on object creation/deletion
- **S3 Batch Operations**: Large-scale batch processing
- **S3 Select**: Query data directly in S3 without retrieval
- **Analytics Integration**: Direct integration with AWS analytics services

## Monitoring and Cost Management

### Storage Metrics
- **CloudWatch Metrics**: Storage utilization, request metrics, and data transfer
- **S3 Storage Lens**: Organization-wide visibility into storage usage
- **Cost Analysis**: Detailed cost breakdown by storage class
- **Access Patterns**: Analysis of data access patterns for optimization

### Cost Optimization Strategies
- **Storage Class Analysis**: Recommendations for optimal storage classes
- **Incomplete Multipart Upload Cleanup**: Automated cleanup policies
- **Lifecycle Policy Optimization**: Regular review and optimization
- **Reserved Capacity**: Cost savings for predictable storage needs

## Backup and Recovery

### S3 as Backup Target
- **Database Backups**: Automated RDS backup storage
- **Application Backups**: Application data and configuration backups
- **Document Backups**: Critical document backup and archival
- **Kubernetes Backups**: Velero backup storage target

### Recovery Procedures
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Using versioning and lifecycle policies

- **Bulk Restore**: S3 Batch Operations for large-scale restore
- **Recovery Testing**: Regular recovery drills and validation

## Client-Specific Configuration

### Multi-Tenant Storage
