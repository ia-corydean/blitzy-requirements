# 49.0 Event-Driven Messaging Architecture

## Architecture Evolution Strategy

### Phase 1: Laravel Queues (Initial Implementation)
- **Technology**: Laravel Queue system with Redis backend
- **Use Cases**: Background jobs, email notifications, document processing
- **Volume**: Suitable for < 10,000 events per second
- **Benefits**: Simple implementation, built-in Laravel support
- **Limitations**: Single Redis instance bottleneck, limited event replay

### Phase 2: Apache Kafka (Future Scale)
- **Trigger Points**: 
  - Event volume > 10,000/second
  - Need for event replay and audit
  - Multi-region event distribution
  - Complex event processing requirements
- **Architecture**: Distributed event streaming platform
- **Benefits**: High throughput, event sourcing, replay capability

## Event Processing Patterns

### Event Sourcing
- **Complete History**: All state changes stored as events
- **Audit Trail**: Immutable event log for compliance
- **State Reconstruction**: Rebuild state from event history
- **Temporal Queries**: Point-in-time state queries
- **Event Store**: Dedicated event storage with fast replay

### Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
- **Write Model**: Commands produce events
- **Read Model**: Optimized projections for queries
- **Consistency**: Eventual consistency between models
- **Performance**: Optimized read and write paths
- **Scalability**: Independent scaling of read/write sides

### Saga Pattern
- **Long-Running Transactions**: Multi-step business processes
- **Compensation**: Automatic rollback on failures
- **State Management**: Persistent saga state
- **Examples**:
  - Policy binding saga
  - Claim settlement saga
  - Payment processing saga

## Laravel Queue Implementation

### Queue Configuration
```php
// config/queue.php
'connections' => [
    'redis' => [
        'driver' => 'redis',
        'connection' => 'cache',
        'queue' => env('REDIS_QUEUE', 'default'),
        'retry_after' => 90,
        'block_for' => null,
        'after_commit' => false,
    ],
]
```

### Job Processing
- **Job Types**:
  - Email notifications
  - Document generation
  - External API calls
  - Data synchronization
  - Report generation
- **Queue Priorities**: High, normal, low priority queues
- **Job Batching**: Batch processing for efficiency
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent overwhelming external services

### Queue Monitoring

services:
  policy-manager:
    subscribes:
      - quote-events
