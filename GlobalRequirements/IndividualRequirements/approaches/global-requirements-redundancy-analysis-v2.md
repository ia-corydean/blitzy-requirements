## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Split Combined Requirements
1. Split GR-05-10 into GR-05 and GR-10
2. Split GR-08-27 into GR-08 and GR-27
3. Split GR-15-26-31 into GR-15, GR-26, and GR-31
4. Split GR-28-29-30 into GR-28, GR-29, and GR-30

### Phase 2: Add Master Requirements
1. Update GR-12 as Security Master
2. Update GR-22 as Architecture Master
3. Update GR-41 as Database Master
4. Update GR-48 as Integration Master

### Phase 3: Add Scopes and References
1. Add scope statements to all overlapping requirements
2. Add cross-references between related requirements
3. Update content to match new scopes

### Phase 4: Deprecate or Update
1. Decision on GR-38 (Microservice Architecture)
2. Remove redundant content from all files
3. Validate no orphaned references

## Summary

This V2 analysis provides specific, actionable changes for each redundancy. The key principles are:
1. Create clear master/implementation hierarchies
2. Add explicit scope statements
3. Use consistent cross-referencing
4. Remove duplicated content
5. Maintain single source of truth for each concept
