# Global Requirements Redundancy Analysis

## Overview
This document analyzes all Global Requirements in the IndividualRequirements directory to identify redundancies, overlapping scope, and opportunities for consolidation.

## Analysis Summary

### Total Requirements Analyzed: 57 Global Requirements

## Redundancies and Overlapping Scope

### 1. Testing Requirements Overlap
**Files**: 
- GR-05-10: Testing Requirements (Combined)
- GR-51: Compliance Audit Architecture (includes testing compliance)

**Overlap**: Both cover testing standards and requirements
**Recommendation**: Keep GR-05-10 for technical testing, ensure GR-51 focuses only on compliance testing
- what would be the exact changes?

### 2. Performance Requirements Overlap
**Files**:
- GR-08-27: Performance Requirements (Combined)
- GR-25: Observability Logging (includes performance monitoring)

**Overlap**: Performance monitoring appears in both
**Recommendation**: GR-08-27 should define performance standards, GR-25 should focus on how to monitor them
- what would be the exact changes?

### 3. CI/CD Requirements Overlap
**Files**:
- GR-15-26-31: CI/CD Requirements (Combined - 3 topics)
- GR-32: Deployment Orchestration
- GR-23: Deployment Scalability

**Overlap**: Deployment strategies appear in multiple files
**Recommendation**: Split GR-15-26-31 into separate requirements, consolidate deployment topics
- what would be the exact changes?

### 4. Docker Requirements Overlap
**Files**:
- GR-28-29-30: Docker Requirements (Combined - 3 topics)
- GR-32: Deployment Orchestration (includes container orchestration)

**Overlap**: Container management in both
**Recommendation**: Split GR-28-29-30, merge container orchestration into GR-32
- what would be the exact changes?

### 5. Security Architecture Overlap
**Files**:
- GR-12: Security Considerations
- GR-24: Data Security
- GR-36: Authentication User Groups Permissions
- GR-66: PCI DSS Compliance Architecture

**Overlap**: Security standards spread across multiple files
**Recommendation**: GR-12 as master security, others as specific implementations
- what would be the exact changes?

### 6. Database Standards Overlap
**Files**:
- GR-02: Database Migrations
- GR-03: Models Relationships
- GR-19: Table Relationships Requirements
- GR-40: Database Seeding Requirements
- GR-41: Table Schema Requirements

**Overlap**: Database design standards in multiple places
**Recommendation**: Consolidate core standards in GR-41, others reference it
- what would be the exact changes?

### 7. Logging and Monitoring Overlap
**Files**:
- GR-13: Error Handling Logging
- GR-25: Observability Logging
- GR-37: Locking Workflow with Centralized Logging

**Overlap**: Logging requirements scattered
**Recommendation**: GR-25 for infrastructure logging, GR-13 for application logging, GR-37 specifically for audit logs
- what would be the exact changes?

### 8. Architecture Documentation Overlap
**Files**:
- GR-17: High Level Functional Requirements
- GR-22: High Level Architecture
- GR-38: Microservice Architecture

**Overlap**: Architecture decisions in multiple files
**Recommendation**: GR-22 as master architecture, others as specific views
- what would be the exact changes?
- microservice architecture isn't relevant with the new requirements, right?

### 9. Integration Architecture Overlap
**Files**:
- GR-21: Integration with Other Stack Components
- GR-47: API Gateway Service Mesh Architecture
- GR-48: External Integrations Catalog
- GR-53: DCS Integration Architecture

**Overlap**: Integration patterns repeated
**Recommendation**: GR-48 as catalog, others as specific implementations
- what would be the exact changes?

### 10. Communication/Messaging Overlap
**Files**:
- GR-44: Comprehensive Communication Architecture
- GR-49: Event Driven Messaging Architecture

**Overlap**: Messaging patterns in both
**Recommendation**: GR-44 for external communications, GR-49 for internal events
- what would be the exact changes?

## Requirements That Should Be Split

### 1. GR-05-10: Testing Requirements
**Current**: Combines units 5 and 10
**Recommendation**: Split into:
- GR-05: Unit and Integration Testing
- GR-10: System and Acceptance Testing

### 2. GR-08-27: Performance Requirements
**Current**: Combines units 8 and 27
**Recommendation**: Split into:
- GR-08: Frontend Performance Requirements
- GR-27: Backend Performance Requirements

### 3. GR-15-26-31: CI/CD Requirements
**Current**: Combines units 15, 26, and 31
**Recommendation**: Split into:
- GR-15: Continuous Integration Requirements
- GR-26: Continuous Deployment Requirements
- GR-31: Pipeline Automation Requirements

### 4. GR-28-29-30: Docker Requirements
**Current**: Combines units 28, 29, and 30
**Recommendation**: Split into:
- GR-28: Docker Container Requirements
- GR-29: Docker Compose Requirements
- GR-30: Docker Registry Requirements

## Single-Purpose Requirements (Well-Scoped)

These requirements maintain good singular focus:
- GR-00: Technology Version Standards
- GR-01: Identity Access Management
- GR-04: Validation Data Handling
- GR-06: Project Structure Organization
- GR-07: Reusable Components UI Consistency
- GR-09: State Management
- GR-10: SR22/SR26 Filing (Note: Different from testing GR-10)
- GR-11: Accessibility
- GR-14: Documentation
- GR-18: Workflow Requirements
- GR-20: Application Business Logic
- GR-42: System Configuration Options
- GR-43: Global Document Generation
- GR-45: Paperless Workflow Enrollment
- GR-46: AWS S3 Storage Architecture
- GR-50: Disaster Recovery Backup Strategy
- GR-52: Universal Entity Management
- GR-63: Aguila Dorada Program Traits
- GR-64: Policy Reinstatement with Lapse Process
- GR-65: Payment Processing Architecture Delta
- GR-67: Form Implementation Standards
- GR-68: Pattern Reuse Guidelines
- GR-69: Producer Portal Architecture
- GR-70: Accounting Architecture

## Recommendations for Consolidation

### 1. Create Master Requirements
- **Security Master**: GR-12 references GR-24, GR-36, GR-66
- **Database Master**: GR-41 references GR-02, GR-03, GR-19, GR-40
- **Architecture Master**: GR-22 references GR-17, GR-38
- **Integration Master**: GR-48 references GR-21, GR-47, GR-53

### 2. Split Combined Requirements
- Split all multi-number requirements (05-10, 08-27, 15-26-31, 28-29-30)
- Each split requirement should have singular focus
- Update all cross-references after splitting

### 3. Clarify Scope Boundaries
- Add "Scope" section to each requirement
- Add "Not in Scope" section to prevent overlap
- Add "See Also" section for related requirements

### 4. Remove Redundant Content
- Eliminate duplicate definitions
- Create single source of truth for each concept
- Use references instead of repetition

## Priority Actions

1. **High Priority**: Split combined requirements (05-10, 08-27, 15-26-31, 28-29-30)
2. **Medium Priority**: Consolidate database requirements under GR-41
3. **Medium Priority**: Clarify security requirement boundaries
4. **Low Priority**: Add cross-references between related requirements

## Impact Assessment

- **Development Impact**: Clearer requirements reduce confusion
- **Maintenance Impact**: Single source of truth easier to update
- **Compliance Impact**: Clear boundaries improve audit compliance
- **Training Impact**: Simpler structure easier to understand

## Next Steps

1. Get stakeholder approval for splitting combined requirements
2. Create new individual requirement files for split items
3. Update all cross-references in affected files
4. Add scope clarification sections to overlapping requirements
5. Create reference matrix showing requirement relationships
