# GR-10: SR22/SR26 Financial Responsibility Filing Requirements

## Overview
This Global Requirement establishes comprehensive standards for SR22 and SR26 financial responsibility filing processes within insurance management systems. SR22 filings provide proof of financial responsibility required by state authorities for drivers who must demonstrate insurance coverage due to specific violations or court orders. SR26 filings handle the cancellation of SR22 requirements. This requirement provides a program-agnostic framework that can be implemented across multiple insurance programs while maintaining regulatory compliance and operational efficiency.

## 1. SR22 Filing Requirements

- **SR22 Filing**: State-mandated proof of financial responsibility for drivers required to demonstrate insurance coverage
- **Legal Function**: Satisfies court orders or state requirements for financial responsibility verification
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meets state-specific requirements for insurance verification programs

### Eligibility Criteria
- **Driver License Requirement**: Must possess valid driver's license in the state where SR22 is required
- **Policy Status**: Must be a rated driver on an active insurance policy
- **Geographic Restriction**: Filing limited to states where carrier is licensed and authorized

### SR22 Reason Categories
Standard reason categories for SR22 requirements:
1. **DWI or DUI Conviction** - Driving while intoxicated or under the influence
2. **Driving Without Insurance** - Operating a vehicle without required insurance coverage
3. **Multiple Traffic Offenses in a Short Period** - Accumulation of violations within specified timeframe
4. **At-Fault Accident Without Insurance** - Causing accident while uninsured
5. **License Suspension or Revocation** - Administrative or court-ordered license actions
