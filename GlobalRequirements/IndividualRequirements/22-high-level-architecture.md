# 22.0 High Level Architecture

## Cloud-First AWS Infrastructure

### Foundation Architecture
- **Primary Platform**: Amazon Web Services (AWS) for comprehensive cloud infrastructure
- **Deployment Strategy**: Multi-region active-active deployment for high availability
- **Container Orchestration**: AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) with per-client namespace isolation
- **Operating System**: Debian Linux for all containerized services for stability and compatibility

### Client Isolation Strategy
- **Dedicated Namespace per Tenant**: Each client operates within a distinct Kubernetes namespace
- **Resource Management**: CPU and memory managed at namespace level for independent monitoring and scaling
- **Database Isolation**: Each client receives dedicated MariaDB RDS instance for complete data separation
- **Network Isolation**: Client-specific VLANs and security groups for network-level separation

## Container Orchestration Architecture

### Cloud-First Deployment Strategy

#### Kubernetes vs. Serverless Decision Matrix
For the insurance system's cloud-first approach, we evaluate container orchestration vs. serverless options:

**Kubernetes Benefits for Insurance Systems:**
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Fine-grained control over data residency and security policies
- **Multi-Tenant Isolation**: Namespace-based tenant separation with resource quotas
- **Hybrid Scaling**: Mix of always-on services and event-driven scaling
- **Vendor Flexibility**: Avoid vendor lock-in while leveraging AWS services
- **Complex Workflows**: Better suited for long-running insurance processes (underwriting, claims)

**AWS EKS Configuration**
- **Kubernetes Version**: 1.30+ for enhanced security and performance features
- **Managed Kubernetes**: EKS provides managed control plane with AWS-native integrations
- **Client Namespace Isolation**: 
  - Each tenant operates in isolated Kubernetes namespace
  - Client-specific resource quotas and limits
  - Independent scaling policies per client tier (Premium/Standard/Basic)
- **Pod Management**:
  - Horizontal Pod Autoscaling based on custom metrics
  - Vertical Pod Autoscaling for resource optimization
  - Pod Disruption Budgets for safe maintenance

### Service Architecture
- **Microservices per Tenant**: Containers replicated for each tenant with dedicated resources
- **Frontend Integration**: React with Minimal UI Kit + Tailwind points to tenant-specific microservices
- **Service Communication**: Istio service mesh for secure mTLS communication between services
- **Load Balancing**: AWS Application Load Balancer with NGINX reverse proxy for internal routing

## Database Architecture

### Client-Isolated MariaDB on AWS RDS
- **MariaDB Version**: 12.x LTS for enhanced performance and security
- **Database Strategy**: Each client receives dedicated MariaDB RDS instance
- **Isolation Benefits**: Complete data separation, regulatory compliance, independent scaling
- **High Availability**: Multi-AZ deployment with automated failover
- **Backup Strategy**: Automated backups with client-specific retention policies and cross-region replication

### Database Features
- **Performance**: Read replicas for analytical workloads separated from transactional operations
- **Monitoring**: AWS RDS Performance Insights for query optimization
- **Security**: Encryption at rest and in transit with VPC isolation
- **Migration**: Laravel migrations ensure consistent schema across client databases

## Security and Compliance

### Zero Trust Security Model
- **Service Mesh Security**: Istio provides mTLS for all service-to-service communication
- **Network Security**: VPC isolation with client-specific security groups
- **Identity Management**: OAuth2/JWT authentication with multi-tenant token isolation
- **Data Protection**: Field-level encryption for PII and sensitive data

### Compliance Architecture
- **Multi-tenant Compliance**: Client-specific compliance configurations
- **Audit Logging**: Immutable audit ledger with append-only database tables
- **Data Retention**: Automated lifecycle management per client requirements
- **Regulatory Support**: State-specific insurance regulation compliance

## Scalability and Performance

### Horizontal Scaling
- **Tenant-Specific Scaling**: Scale individual client resources without affecting other tenants
- **Auto-scaling**: Kubernetes HorizontalPodAutoscaler with custom metrics
- **Resource Efficiency**: Shared infrastructure (masters, nodes, monitoring) with isolated applications
- **Performance Optimization**: Client-specific performance tuning and resource allocation

### Load Management
- **Traffic Routing**: Domain-based or path-based routing (tenantA.example.com vs tenantB.example.com)
- **NGINX Ingress**: Ingress rules route traffic to correct tenant namespace
- **CDN Integration**: AWS CloudFront for global content distribution
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-tier caching with AWS ElastiCache for Redis

## Monitoring and Observability

### LGTM Stack Integration
- **Grafana**: Unified dashboards with client-specific views
- **Loki**: Log aggregation with per-client log streams
- **Tempo**: Distributed tracing across microservices
- **Mimir**: High-availability metrics with long-term storage

### AWS CloudWatch Integration
- **Infrastructure Monitoring**: EKS, RDS, S3, and ElastiCache metrics
- **Application Monitoring**: Custom business metrics and KPIs
- **Alerting**: Multi-channel alerting with client-specific notification preferences
- **Cost Monitoring**: Resource utilization tracking and cost optimization per client

## Disaster Recovery and Backup

### Multi-Tier Recovery Strategy
- **AWS Backup**: Automated backup policies for RDS, EBS, and S3
- **Velero**: Kubernetes resource backups with namespace-specific restoration
- **Client-Specific RTO/RPO**: Recovery objectives based on client SLA tiers
- **Cross-Region Replication**: Multi-region disaster recovery capabilities

### Backup Isolation
- **Tenant-Specific Backups**: Individual backup and restore operations per client
- **Namespace Snapshots**: Complete namespace backup including persistent volumes
- **Data Integrity**: Backup verification and integrity checking
- **Geographic Distribution**: Multi-region backup storage for compliance requirements
