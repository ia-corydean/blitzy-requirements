# 43.0 Global Document Generation Process Requirement

The Global Document Generation Process is designed to produce high-quality, standardized documents by merging dynamic system data with predefined HTML templates. This process enables the automated creation of essential documents—such as policy agreements and claim reports—while ensuring consistency, compliance, and traceability throughout the platform.

**Core Process Components**

**Template Management and Selection**

- **Template Repository:**
    - All document templates are centrally stored in the system’s template table.
    - Each template comprises HTML content with placeholders for dynamic data, and is categorized by type (e.g., email, document, system message) with a unique identifier.
- **Template Selection:**
    - Users or system processes select an appropriate template based on the desired document type.
    - The selected template’s metadata (name, content, status, etc.) drives the document generation process.

**Data Retrieval and Preparation**

- **Dynamic Data Collection:**
    - Retrieve all necessary data (e.g., policy details, user information, claims data) from associated microservices via APIs or database queries.
    - Ensure data items are gathered from reliable sources such as Policy, User, and Claims services.
- **Data Standardization:**
    - Standardize and reference all retrieved data using unique IDs to maintain consistency across the system.
    - This standardization guarantees that data aligns with system-wide mapping and joining requirements during document generation

**Template Merging and Rendering**

- **Merging Engine:**
    - Utilize a templating engine (e.g., Laravel Blade) to dynamically merge data into the HTML content of the selected template.
    - Replace placeholders with actual data values to produce a fully rendered HTML document.
- **Document Formatting:**
    - Apply consistent styling and formatting to the rendered HTML, ensuring that headers, footers, logos, and other visual elements conform to the system’s design guidelines

**Document Conversion and Generation**

- **Conversion Technology:**
    - Convert the rendered HTML into a final document format—typically PDF—using a conversion tool such as wkhtmltopdf or an equivalent solution.
    - This step ensures that the final document is portable, secure, and suitable for both digital delivery and printing.
- **Quality Assurance:**
    - Validate the generated document to confirm that all dynamic data has been accurately merged and the document is correctly formatted.
    - Employ testing routines to ensure the document meets predefined quality standards.

**Mapping, Storage, and Audit**

- **Mapping Records:**
    - After document generation, create a mapping record that links the generated document (via its unique document_id) with the template used (via template_id).
    - The mapping is maintained in the map_lock_action table, ensuring traceability and consistency for future reference.
- **Document Storage:**
    - Store the final document in AWS S3 with hierarchical storage management for cost optimization.
    - Implement hot/warm/cold storage tiers based on document access patterns and retention policies.
    - Use S3 versioning for document history and lifecycle policies for automated archival.
- **Audit Logging:**
    - Log every step of the document generation process—including template selection, data merging, conversion, and mapping—in the action table.
    - Capture metadata such as timestamps, user references, and status updates to support comprehensive audit trails

**Delivery and User Interaction**

- **Document Preview and Download:**
    - Provide a user interface for previewing generated documents in an embedded viewer.
    - Enable both single and bulk download options for user convenience.
- **Integration with System Workflows:**
    - Link generated documents to relevant system entities (e.g., policies, claims) based on mapping records.
    - Integrate with notification systems to alert users when new documents are available.

**Technical Specifications**

- **Template Engine:**
    - Use Laravel’s Blade (or an equivalent templating engine) to manage dynamic data merging into HTML templates.
- **Conversion Tools:**
    - Employ tools such as wkhtmltopdf or Barryvdh/Laravel-Snappy for converting HTML to PDF.
- **Mapping and Audit:**
    - Maintain mapping records in the map_lock_action table to ensure each generated document is traceable back to its source template.
    - Store all audit logs in the action table with detailed metadata.
- **Data Consistency:**
    - All dynamic data must be standardized and referenced by unique IDs to support reliable joins and mappings across the system.

**Integration with Platform Components**

- **Frontend:**
    - A React-based UI provides responsive access for previewing and downloading documents.
    - Ensures a seamless user experience across desktop and mobile devices.
- **Backend:**
    - Laravel handles the core business logic, integrating with microservices (Policy, User, Claims) for data retrieval.
    - Exposes REST or GraphQL APIs for communication with the frontend.
- **Storage:**
    - Utilize AWS S3 for secure, scalable document storage with intelligent tiering and lifecycle management.
    - Implement S3 bucket policies for access control and cross-region replication for disaster recovery.
- **Observability:**
    - Integrate with logging and monitoring tools (e.g., LGTM stack, Prometheus, Grafana) to track document generation processes and ensure system health.

**Performance, Security, and Maintenance Considerations**

- **Performance:**
    - Optimize the merging and conversion processes to handle large volumes of document generation efficiently.
    - Use caching and batch processing where necessary to enhance performance.
- **Security:**
    - Ensure that all document data is securely transmitted and stored, with proper access controls enforced via OAuth2/JWT.
    - Audit logging must capture every document generation event to support regulatory compliance.
- **Maintenance:**
    - Regularly update templates and conversion tools to maintain compatibility with evolving standards.
    - Implement scheduled backups of the document repository to prevent data loss.
