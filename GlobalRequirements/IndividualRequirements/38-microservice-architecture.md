# 38.0 Microservice Architecture

## Architecture Strategy: Mono-Repo with Microservice Evolution

### Current Implementation Approach
- **Mono-Repo Strategy**: Single repository containing all components for unified development
- **Monolith-First**: Begin with Laravel monolith for rapid development and deployment
- **Microservice Readiness**: Code structured with clear service boundaries for future extraction
- **Gradual Evolution**: Extract individual services as they reach sufficient complexity and scale
- **Service Boundaries**: Well-defined domain boundaries (Authentication, Policy, Claims, etc.)

### Future Microservice Extraction Criteria
- **Size Threshold**: Services become candidates for extraction when they exceed team capacity
- **Performance Needs**: Extract when independent scaling becomes necessary
- **Team Autonomy**: Extract when separate teams need independent deployment cycles
- **Technology Divergence**: Extract when different technology stacks provide significant advantages

## Technology Stack Requirements
- **Backend Framework**: Laravel 12.x+ with PHP 8.4+ for microservice implementation
- **Frontend Framework**: React 18+ with TypeScript 5.x for service interfaces
- **Container Runtime**: Docker 24.0+ for containerized microservices
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes 1.30+ for microservice deployment and management
- **Database**: MariaDB 12.x LTS for individual service data stores
- **Message Bus**: Apache Kafka 3.x for inter-service communication
- **Service Mesh**: Istio 1.20+ for secure service-to-service communication
- **API Gateway**: Kong 3.x for API management and routing
