            - For each premium record from premium, calculate:

              `premium_net` = `premium.credit` – `premium.debit`.

            - Sum all `premium_net` values to obtain Total Premium.
        - Aggregate fee data:
            - Use `map_policy_fee_transaction` where `policy_id` = `policy.id`.
            - For each fee record from fee, calculate:

              `fee_net` = `fee.debit` – `fee.credit`.

            - Sum all `fee_net` values to obtain Total Fees.
        - Aggregate payment transactions:
            - Use `map_policy_installment_transaction` where `policy_id` = `policy.id`.
            - For each transaction from transaction, sum the debit amounts (payments are recorded as debits).
            - Sum these amounts to get Total Payments Applied.
        - Compute net premium remaining:

                - Next Payment Amount = `installment.total` – `installment.paid_to_date`.
            - If no installment record exists:
                - Next Installment Amount = Net Premium Remaining / Remaining Installments.

            - Identify the earliest due date among these outstanding installments/fees.
        - Calculate the next billing date dynamically:
            - If today’s date is before the `installment_due_day`, then set the calculated next due date to the current month’s `installment_due_day`.
                - Example: If today is the 10th and `installment_due_day` is 15, then next due date = the 15th of the current month.
            - If today’s date is on or after the `installment_due_day`, then set the calculated next due date to the `installment_due_day` in the next month.
                - Example: If today is the 16th and `installment_due_day` is 15, then next due date = the 15th of the next month.
        - Determine the effective due date:
            - Compare the dynamically calculated due date with the earliest due date from outstanding installments/fees (if any exist).
            - The Next Payment Due Date is the earliest of:
                - The dynamically calculated next due date based on `installment_due_day`, or
                - The earliest `due_date` among outstanding installment/fee records.
        - Set the due date in the new installment record:
            - When generating a new installment record (via a cronjob or event trigger), assign its `due_date` field to the determined Next Payment Due Date.
        - This `due_date` becomes the Due Date of the Next Payment.

    - Compute Total Term Premium:
        - Sum all `premium_net` values from the premium records to obtain the Total Term Premium Due for the entire term.
    - Table Summary:
        - `policy` `(id`)
        - `map_user_policy_driver` (`user.id`, `policy.id`)

# #2 - Drivers and Vehicles

## **A) WHY - Vision and Purpose**

The **Drivers & Vehicles** section in the **Policy Summary** provides users with a **clear and structured view of all insured drivers and vehicles** associated with their insurance policy. This feature ensures **policy transparency** and allows users to verify their coverage details, track active and excluded drivers, and confirm the insured vehicles linked to their policy.

## **B) WHAT - Core Requirements**

### **1. Drivers Section**

- Display **all drivers** associated with the policy.
- Show key driver details:
    - **Name**
        - Driver Name → get `map_policy_driver` by `policy.id` -> get `driver.id` by `map_policy_driver.driver_id` -> get driver by `driver.id` -> get `name.id` by `driver.name_id` -> get `name`
    - **Date of Birth**
        - Driver Date of Birth → get `map_policy_driver` by [`policy.id`](http://policy.id/) -> get [`driver.id`](http://driver.id/) by `map_policy_driver.driver_id` -> get `driver` by [`driver.id`](http://driver.id/) -> get `driver.date_of_birth`
    - **License Number**
        - Driver’s License Number → get `map_policy_driver` by [`policy.id`](http://policy.id/) -> get [`driver.id`](http://driver.id/) by `map_policy_driver.driver_id` -> get `driver` by [`driver.id`](http://driver.id/) -> get [`license.id`](http://license.id/) by `driver.license_id` -> get `license` by [`license.id`](http://license.id/)
    - **Status (e.g., “Included” or “Excluded”)**
        - Driver Status (Included vs Excluded) → get `map_policy_driver` by [`policy.id`](http://policy.id/) -> get [`driver.id`](http://driver.id/) by `map_policy_driver.driver_id` -> get `driver` by [`driver.id`](http://driver.id/) -> get `driver_type.id` by `driver.driver_type_id` -> driver types defined for included and excluded

### **2. Vehicles Section**

- Display **all insured vehicles** in the policy.
- Show key vehicle details:
    - **Make, Model, and Year**
        - Vehicle Year → get `map_policy_driver_vehicle` by [`policy.id`](http://policy.id/) -> get [`vehicle.id`](http://vehicle.id/) by `map_policy_driver_vehicle.vehicle_id` -> get `vehicle_year.id` by `vehicle.vehicle_year_id` -> get `vehicle_year` by `vehicle_year.id` -> get `vehicle_year.value`
        - Vehicle Make → get `map_policy_driver_vehicle` by [`policy.id`](http://policy.id/) -> get [`vehicle.id`](http://vehicle.id/) by `map_policy_driver_vehicle.vehicle_id` -> get `vehicle_make.id` by `vehicle.vehicle_make_id` -> get `vehicle_make` by `vehicle_make.id` -> get `vehicle_make.name`
        - Vehicle Model → get `map_policy_driver_vehicle` by `policy.id` -> get [`vehicle.id`](http://vehicle.id/) by `map_policy_driver_vehicle.vehicle_id` -> get `vehicle_model.id` by `vehicle.vehicle_model_id` -> get `vehicle_model` by `vehicle_model.id` and `vehicle.vehicle_make_id` -> get `vehicle_model.name`
        - Vehicle License Plate Number → get `map_policy_driver_vehicle` by [`policy.id`](http://policy.id/) -> get [`vehicle.id`](http://vehicle.id/) by `map_policy_driver_vehicle.vehicle_id` -> get `vehicle` by [`vehicle.id`](http://vehicle.id/) -> get `license_plate` by `vehicle.license_plate_id` -> get `license_plate.number`
    - **VIN**
        - Vehicle VIN → get `map_policy_driver_vehicle` by [`policy.id`](http://policy.id/) -> get [`vehicle.id`](http://vehicle.id/) by `map_policy_driver_vehicle.vehicle_id` -> get `vehicle` by [`vehicle.id`](http://vehicle.id/) -> get `vehicle.vin`

### **3. Interactive Features**

- Expand/collapse sections for **Drivers & Vehicles** to optimize readability.
- Ability to quickly **switch between policy summary tabs** (Overview, Drivers & Vehicles, Coverage).

## **C) HOW - Planning & Implementation**

**Full Mapping of Front-End Fields to Database Fields**

- Producer Label Configuration → Stored in the appropriate application side configuration file.
- Policy Number → get [`policy.id`](http://policy.id/) from `map_user_policy_driver` by [`user.id`](http://user.id/) -> get `policy` by [`policy.id`](http://policy.id/) -> get `policy_prefix` by `policy.policy_prefix_id` -> concat `policy_prefix.value` and `policy.number`
- Policy Status → get [`policy.id`](http://policy.id/) from `map_user_policy_driver` by [`user.id`](http://user.id/) -> get `policy` by [`policy.id`](http://policy.id/) -> `policy.status_id`
- Named Insured Name → get [`policy.id`](http://policy.id/) from `map_user_policy_driver` by [`user.id`](http://user.id/) -> get `map_policy_named_driver` by [`policy.id`](http://policy.id/) -> get [`driver.id`](http://driver.id/) by m`ap_policy_named_driver.driver_id` -> get `driver` by [`driver.id](http://driver.id/)` -> get `name` by `driver.name_id`
- Next Payment Amount
    - Retrieve the policy record:
        - Use `map_user_policy_driver` by `user.id` to obtain `policy.id`.
        - Retrieve the policy record from policy to access `installment_due_day` and `term_months`.
    - Aggregate premium data:
        - Use `map_policy_premium_transaction` where `policy_id` = `policy.id`.
        - For each premium record from premium, calculate:

          `premium_net` = `premium.credit` – `premium.debit`.

        - Sum all `premium_net` values to obtain Total Premium.
    - Aggregate fee data:
        - Use `map_policy_fee_transaction` where `policy_id` = `policy.id`.
        - For each fee record from fee, calculate:

          `fee_net` = `fee.debit` – `fee.credit`.

        - Sum all `fee_net` values to obtain Total Fees.
    - Aggregate payment transactions:
        - Use `map_policy_installment_transaction` where `policy_id` = `policy.id`.
        - For each transaction from transaction, sum the debit amounts (payments are recorded as debits).
        - Sum these amounts to get Total Payments Applied.
    - Compute net premium remaining:
        - Net Premium Remaining = (Total Premium + Total Fees) – (Total Payments Applied).
    - Determine the remaining installment count:
        - Count the number of installment records for the policy via `map_policy_installment_transaction`.
        - Remaining Installments = `policy.term_months` – (count of installment records).
    - Calculate Next Payment Amount:
        - If an installment record exists (with status "Pending" or "Partially Paid"):
            - Next Payment Amount = `installment.total` – `installment.paid_to_date`.
        - If no installment record exists:
            - Next Installment Amount = Net Premium Remaining / Remaining Installments.
    - Table Summary:
        - `policy` (`id`, `installment_due_day`, `term_months`)
        - `map_user_policy_driver` (`user.id`, `policy.id`)
        - `map_policy_premium_transaction` (`policy_id`, `premium_id`)
        - `premium` (`credit`, `debit`)
        - `map_policy_fee_transaction` (`policy_id`, `fee_id`)
        - `fee` (`debit`, `credit`)
        - `map_policy_installment_transaction` (`policy_id`, `installment_id`)
        - `transaction` (`debit`, `processed_date`)
        - `installment` (`total`, `paid_to_date`, `due_date`, `status_id`)
- Due Date of Next Payment
    - Retrieve the policy record:
        - Use `map_user_policy_driver` by `user.id` to obtain `policy.id`.
        - Retrieve the policy record from `policy` to access `installment_due_day`.
    - Check for outstanding items:
        - Retrieve any installment records for the policy via `map_policy_installment_transaction` with status "Pending" or "Partially Paid" and extract their `due_date` values.
        - Retrieve fee records via `map_policy_fee_transaction` (if fees have due dates and outstanding balances) and extract their `due_date` values.
        - Identify the earliest due date among these outstanding installments/fees.
    - Calculate the next billing date dynamically:
        - If today’s date is before the `installment_due_day`, then set the calculated next due date to the current month’s `installment_due_day`.
            - Example: If today is the 10th and `installment_due_day` is 15, then next due date = the 15th of the current month.
        - If today’s date is on or after the `installment_due_day`, then set the calculated next due date to the `installment_due_day` in the next month.
            - Example: If today is the 16th and `installment_due_day` is 15, then next due date = the 15th of the next month.
    - Determine the effective due date:
        - Compare the dynamically calculated due date with the earliest due date from outstanding installments/fees (if any exist).
        - The Next Payment Due Date is the earliest of:
            - The dynamically calculated next due date based on `installment_due_day`, or
            - The earliest `due_date` among outstanding installment/fee records.
    - Set the due date in the new installment record:
        - When generating a new installment record (via a cronjob or event trigger), assign its `due_date` field to the determined Next Payment Due Date.
    - This `due_date` becomes the Due Date of the Next Payment.

# #3 - Coverage

## **A) WHY - Vision and Purpose**

The **Coverage** section in the **Policy Summary** provides users with a **clear, structured breakdown of their insurance coverage details**. It ensures **policy transparency** by showing coverage types, limits, and associated premiums. Users can **easily review what is covered** under their policy, ensuring they have adequate protection and avoiding potential gaps in coverage.

## **B) WHAT - Core Requirements**

### **1. Coverage Breakdown**

- Display **each coverage type** included in the policy.
- Show key details for each coverage:
    - **Coverage Type** (e.g., Bodily Injury, Property Damage)
        - `map_policy_coverage_limit` by [`policy.id`](http://policy.id/) -> get `map_vehicle_coverage_limit` by `map_policy_driver_vehicle.vehicle_id` -> get `map_driver_coverage_limit` by `map_policy_driver_vehicle.driver_id` -> get [`coverage.id`](http://coverage.id/) by `map_policy_coverage_limit.coverage_id` and `map_vehicle_coverage_limit.coverage_id` and `map_driver_coverage_limit.coverage_id` -> get `coverage` by [`coverage.id`](http://coverage.id/) -> get `coverage_type.id` by `coverage.coverage_type_id` -> get `coverage_type.name` by `coverage_type.id`
    - **Coverage Limits** (e.g., $50,000/person - $100,000/accident)
        - Coverage Limit → get `map_policy_driver_vehicle` by [`policy.id`](http://policy.id/) -> get `map_policy_coverage_limit` by [`policy.id`](http://policy.id/) -> get `map_vehicle_coverage_limit` by `map_policy_driver_vehicle.vehicle_id` -> get [`coverage.id`](http://coverage.id/) by `map_policy_coverage_limit.coverage_id` and `map_vehicle_coverage_limit.coverage_id` -> get [`limit.id`](http://limit.id/) by `map_policy_coverage_limit` and `map_vehicle_coverage_limit`
    - **Premium Amount** (e.g., $210.00 for Bodily Injury)
        - Coverage Premium → get `map_policy_driver_vehicle` by [`policy.id`](http://policy.id/) -> get `map_policy_coverage_limit` by [`policy.id`](http://policy.id/) -> get `map_vehicle_coverage_limit` by `map_policy_driver_vehicle.vehicle_id` -> get `map_driver_coverage_limit` by `map_policy_driver_vehicle.driver_id` -> get [`coverage.id`](http://coverage.id/) by `map_policy_coverage_limit.coverage_id` and `map_vehicle_coverage_limit.coverage_id` and `map_driver_coverage_limit.coverage_id` -> get `coverage` by [`coverage.id`](http://coverage.id/) -> get `map_coverage_premium` by [`coverage.id`](http://coverage.id/) -> get [`premium.id`](http://premium.id/) by `map_coverage_premium.premium_id` -> get `premium` by [`premium.id`](http://premium.id/) -> get `sum` of `premium.credit` and `premium.debit`

### **2. Total Policy Cost**

- Display a **total premium amount** summing up all coverage types.
    - Total Policy Premium
        - Retrieve the policy record:
            - Use `map_user_policy_driver` by `user.id` to obtain `policy.id`.
            - Retrieve the policy record from `policy` to access policy details.
        - Retrieve premium records:
            - Use `map_policy_premium_transaction` where `policy_id` = `policy.id` to fetch all associated premium records.
        - Calculate Base Premium:
            - For each premium record retrieved from premium, compute:
                - `premium_net` = `premium.credit` – `premium.debit`.
        - Compute Total Term Premium:
            - Sum all `premium_net` values from the premium records to obtain the Total Term Premium Due for the entire term.

### **3. Interactive Features**

- Ability to **expand/collapse coverage details** for better readability.
- Quick navigation between **Overview, Drivers & Vehicles, and Coverage** tabs.

## **C) HOW - Planning & Implementation**

**Full Mapping of Front-End Fields to Database Fields**

- Producer Label Configuration → Stored in the appropriate application side configuration file.
- Policy Number → get [`policy.id`](http://policy.id/) from `map_user_policy_driver` by [`user.id`](http://user.id/) -> get `policy` by [`policy.id`](http://policy.id/) -> get `policy_prefix` by `policy.policy_prefix_id` -> concat `policy_prefix.value` and `policy.number`
- Policy Status → get [`policy.id`](http://policy.id/) from `map_user_policy_driver` by [`user.id`](http://user.id/) -> get `policy` by [`policy.id`](http://policy.id/) -> `policy.status_id`
- Named Insured Name → get [`policy.id`](http://policy.id/) from `map_user_policy_driver` by [`user.id`](http://user.id/) -> get `map_policy_named_driver` by [`policy.id`](http://policy.id/) -> get [`driver.id`](http://driver.id/) by m`ap_policy_named_driver.driver_id` -> get `driver` by [`driver.id](http://driver.id/)` -> get `name` by `driver.name_id`
- Next Payment Amount
    - Retrieve the policy record:
        - Use `map_user_policy_driver` by `user.id` to obtain `policy.id`.
        - Retrieve the policy record from policy to access `installment_due_day` and `term_months`.
    - Aggregate premium data:
        - Use `map_policy_premium_transaction` where `policy_id` = `policy.id`.
        - For each premium record from premium, calculate:

          `premium_net` = `premium.credit` – `premium.debit`.

        - Sum all `premium_net` values to obtain Total Premium.
    - Aggregate fee data:
        - Use `map_policy_fee_transaction` where `policy_id` = `policy.id`.
        - For each fee record from fee, calculate:

          `fee_net` = `fee.debit` – `fee.credit`.

        - Sum all `fee_net` values to obtain Total Fees.
    - Aggregate payment transactions:
        - Use `map_policy_installment_transaction` where `policy_id` = `policy.id`.
        - For each transaction from transaction, sum the debit amounts (payments are recorded as debits).
        - Sum these amounts to get Total Payments Applied.
    - Compute net premium remaining:
        - Net Premium Remaining = (Total Premium + Total Fees) – (Total Payments Applied).
    - Determine the remaining installment count:
        - Count the number of installment records for the policy via `map_policy_installment_transaction`.
        - Remaining Installments = `policy.term_months` – (count of installment records).
    - Calculate Next Payment Amount:
        - If an installment record exists (with status "Pending" or "Partially Paid"):
            - Next Payment Amount = `installment.total` – `installment.paid_to_date`.
        - If no installment record exists:
            - Next Installment Amount = Net Premium Remaining / Remaining Installments.

- Due Date of Next Payment
    - Retrieve the policy record:
        - Use `map_user_policy_driver` by `user.id` to obtain `policy.id`.
        - Retrieve the policy record from `policy` to access `installment_due_day`.
    - Check for outstanding items:
        - Retrieve any installment records for the policy via `map_policy_installment_transaction` with status "Pending" or "Partially Paid" and extract their `due_date` values.
        - Retrieve fee records via `map_policy_fee_transaction` (if fees have due dates and outstanding balances) and extract their `due_date` values.
        - Identify the earliest due date among these outstanding installments/fees.
    - Calculate the next billing date dynamically:
        - If today’s date is before the `installment_due_day`, then set the calculated next due date to the current month’s `installment_due_day`.
            - Example: If today is the 10th and `installment_due_day` is 15, then next due date = the 15th of the current month.
        - If today’s date is on or after the `installment_due_day`, then set the calculated next due date to the `installment_due_day` in the next month.
            - Example: If today is the 16th and `installment_due_day` is 15, then next due date = the 15th of the next month.
    - Determine the effective due date:
        - Compare the dynamically calculated due date with the earliest due date from outstanding installments/fees (if any exist).
        - The Next Payment Due Date is the earliest of:
            - The dynamically calculated next due date based on `installment_due_day`, or
            - The earliest `due_date` among outstanding installment/fee records.
    - Set the due date in the new installment record:
        - When generating a new installment record (via a cronjob or event trigger), assign its `due_date` field to the determined Next Payment Due Date.
    - This `due_date` becomes the Due Date of the Next Payment.
