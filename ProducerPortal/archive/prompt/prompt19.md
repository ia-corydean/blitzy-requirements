instead of creating these seperately
* Aime/workspace/requirements/ProducerPortal/queue/completed/IP269-New-Quote-Step-1-Primary-Insured/sections-c-e.md
* Aime/workspace/requirements/ProducerPortal/queue/completed/IP269-New-Quote-Step-1-Primary-Insured/integration-spec.md
* Technical Architecture in Aime/workspace/requirements/ProducerPortal/queue/completed/IP269-New-Quote-Step-1-Primary-Insured/implementation-summary.md

they should all be consolidated into a singular requirement file.
* tha requirements file should be a complete replacement of the original but with the additions of Aime/workspace/requirements/ProducerPortal/templates/requirement-template.md

Outline the changes to the over workflow in readme claude files and anywhere else we would need to accomodate these changes.
