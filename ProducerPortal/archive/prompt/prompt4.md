if you need to reference Aime/workspace/requirements/ProducerPortal/queue/README.md to regain context of what we're trying to do as a whole, you should.

Keep in mind:
* We are building this from scratch.
* Complexity of initial implmementation should not out-weigh long term maintainability.
* Long term maintainablity and scalablity are the forefront of priority with permormance as a strong factor as well.
* We want to build everything to be structured consistantly with the ability to scale and add features with less code change as possible.
* We want to consider the ability to maintin and configure as much of the system from a ui as reasonably possible.
* We want to design architectures around current methodlogies
