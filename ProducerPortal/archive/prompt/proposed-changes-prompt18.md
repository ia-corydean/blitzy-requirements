## Overview
This document outlines all proposed changes to align entity-catalog.md and CLAUDE.md files with Individual Requirements (GlobalRequirements/IndividualRequirements).

---

## Changes to `/app/workspace/requirements/ProducerPortal/entity-catalog.md`

### 1. Remove Legacy Integration Section (Lines 190-250)
**REMOVE ENTIRE SECTION**: "Integration Management Entities (Legacy - Being Replaced by Universal Entities)"
- Remove: third_party_integration
- Remove: integration_configuration  
- Remove: integration_node
- Remove: integration_field_mapping
- Remove: integration_request
- Remove: integration_verification_result

**Reason**: These legacy patterns are replaced by Universal Entity Management (GR-52)

### 2. Update Entity Count and Status
**Current**: "49+ entities documented across 4 major categories"
**New**: "60+ entities documented across 5 major categories"
**Add**: Last updated reference to Global Requirements alignment

### 3. Enhance Universal Entity Management Section
**Add comprehensive DCS entity types with full schemas**:
- DCS_HOUSEHOLD_DRIVERS (driver verification with detailed JSON schema)
- DCS_HOUSEHOLD_VEHICLES (vehicle data and VIN decoding with schema)
- DCS_CRIMINAL (criminal background verification with schema)

**Add communication service entity types**:
- SENDGRID_EMAIL (email delivery service)
- TWILIO_SMS (SMS and voice communication)

**Add future entity types with complete schemas**:
- ATTORNEY (legal counsel partners)
- BODY_SHOP (vehicle repair facilities) 
- VENDOR (general service providers)

### 4. Add New Major Category
**Add**: "Communication Service Entities" as 5th major category
- Includes SendGrid and Twilio integration patterns
- References GR-44 Communication Architecture

### 5. Enhanced Entity Reuse Guidelines
**Add Global Requirements integration**:
- Reference GR-52 for universal patterns
- Reference GR-44 for communication patterns
- Reference GR-48 for external integrations
- Add performance standards (sub-500ms queries for 10,000+ entities)
- Add compliance requirements (7-year retention)

### 6. Updated Entity Categories Recommendations
**Add recommended entity categories from GR-52**:
- API_INTEGRATION: Third-party API services
- SERVICE_PROVIDER: Business service partners
- FINANCIAL_INSTITUTION: Banks and payment processors
- REGULATORY_BODY: Government and compliance entities
- COMMUNICATION_SERVICE: Email, SMS, voice providers

## Changes to `/app/workspace/requirements/ProducerPortal/CLAUDE.md`

### 1. Remove Legacy Third-Party Integration Section (Lines 49-55)
**REMOVE**: "Third-Party Integration Management" section that references legacy entities
**REPLACE WITH**: Reference to Universal Entity Management patterns from GR-52

### 2. Add Comprehensive Universal Entity Management Section
**New section after line 148** with:
- Core Universal Entity Management architecture from GR-52
- Benefits and performance standards
- Standard entity categories and their purposes
- Component-based security patterns
- Configuration management hierarchy (entity → program → system)
- Zero-code entity type additions

### 3. Add Communication Architecture Patterns Section
**New section** based on GR-44:
- Multi-channel communication framework
- SendGrid email integration patterns with insurance templates
- Twilio SMS and voice integration
- Insurance-specific communication types (claims, quotes, renewals)
- Template management with insurance business logic helpers

### 4. Enhanced Anti-Patterns Section
**Add to existing anti-patterns**:
- DON'T create entity-specific tables when universal pattern applies
- DON'T bypass universal entity management for external entities
- DO apply universal entity management for all external entities
- DO use entity metadata schemas for validation

### 5. Update Integration References
**Add comprehensive Global Requirements references**:
- **Universal Entity Management** → See GR-52
- **Communication Architecture** → See GR-44  
- **External Integrations** → See GR-48
- **DCS Integration** → See GR-53

### 6. Remove Legacy Integration Patterns Section (Lines 213-245)
**REMOVE**: Entire "Third-Party Integration Patterns" section
**REASON**: Replaced by Universal Entity Management patterns

---

## Changes to `/app/workspace/requirements/CLAUDE.md`

### 1. Enhanced Quality Checklist
**Add to Pre-Implementation section**:
- [ ] Verify Universal Entity Management patterns (GR-52)
- [ ] Check communication architecture alignment (GR-44)
- [ ] Validate external integration patterns (GR-48)

**Add to Implementation section**:
- [ ] Apply universal entity management for external entities
- [ ] Use communication patterns for multi-channel messaging
- [ ] Follow performance standards (sub-500ms entity queries)

**Add to Post-Implementation section**:
- [ ] Verify compliance with retention policies (7-year audit trail)
- [ ] Validate communication template functionality
- [ ] Ensure entity metadata schema validation

### 2. Add Universal Entity Management Reference
**Add to Entity & Architecture Patterns section**:
- **Universal Entity Performance Standards** → See GR-52 (sub-500ms queries for 10,000+ entities)
- **Communication Service Integration** → See GR-44 (SendGrid, Twilio patterns)

## Alignment with Individual Requirements

### Key Global Requirements Referenced:
- **GR-52**: Universal Entity Management Architecture
- **GR-44**: Communication Architecture (SendGrid, Twilio)
- **GR-48**: External Integrations Catalog  
- **GR-53**: DCS Integration Architecture
- **GR-41**: Table Schema Requirements
- **GR-19**: Table Relationships Requirements

### Benefits of These Changes:
1. **Removes legacy patterns** that create maintenance overhead
2. **Aligns with proven Universal Entity Management** from GR-52
3. **Provides complete DCS integration schemas** ready for implementation
4. **Establishes communication patterns** for all insurance workflows
5. **Ensures Global Requirements compliance** across all documentation
6. **Creates clear guidance** for external entity management
7. **Includes performance standards** and compliance requirements

## Next Steps

Upon approval, the following files will be updated in this order:
1. Update entity-catalog.md with new entity types and remove legacy section
2. Update ProducerPortal CLAUDE.md with Universal Entity Management patterns
3. Update global CLAUDE.md with enhanced quality checklist

All changes maintain backward compatibility while providing clear migration path from legacy patterns to Universal Entity Management architecture.
