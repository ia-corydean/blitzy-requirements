4.2 Simple Communication Table
-- Source and target (simplified)
source_type ENUM('system', 'user', 'entity') NOT NULL,
source_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
target_type ENUM('system', 'user', 'entity') NOT NULL,
target_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
-- Communication details
channel_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
direction ENUM('inbound', 'outbound') NOT NULL,
-- Simple business context (direct foreign keys)
policy_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL,
loss_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL,
claimant_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL,
entity_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL,
bank_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL,
quote_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL,
driver_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL,
-- Correlation for tracking
correlation_id VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
- This seems too complicated.
- lets keep it to source and target type where they reference the table

Also ensure that we capture these concepts in supporting cluade files to ensure they are porigated and concidered moving forward.

Keep in mind:
* We are building this from scratch.
* Complexity of initial implmementation should not out-weigh long term maintainability.
* Long term maintainablity and scalablity are the forefront of priority with permormance as a strong factor as well.
* We want to build everything to be structured consistantly with the ability to scale and add features with less code change as possible.
* We want to consider the ability to maintin and configure as much of the system from a ui as reasonably possible.
* We want to design architectures around current methodlogies
* We are going to feed all of these requirements to a language model to develop the source code. ensure that we fill it out appropriately.
    * timeline for migration keep in mind that this is being specced out to built from scratch.
