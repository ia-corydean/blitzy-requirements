Create a new file that outlines what changes need to take place in order to account for the decisions made in Aime/workspace/requirements/ProducerPortal/integration-architecture-decision-summary.md

Also ensure that we capture these concepts in supporting cluade files to ensure they are porigated and concidered moving forward.

Keep in mind:
* We are building this from scratch.
* Complexity of initial implmementation should not out-weigh long term maintainability.
* Long term maintainablity and scalablity are the forefront of priority with permormance as a strong factor as well.
* We want to build everything to be structured consistantly with the ability to scale and add features with less code change as possible.
* We want to consider the ability to maintin and configure as much of the system from a ui as reasonably possible.
* We want to design architectures around current methodlogies
* We are going to feed all of these requirements to a language model to develop the source code. ensure that we fill it out appropriately.
  * timeline for migration keep in mind that this is being specced out to built from scratch.
