The requirements in Aime/workspace/requirements/ProducerPortal/queue/completed/IP269-New-Quote-Step-1-Primary-Insured are close but not correct.

When the Search For Existing Record button is pressed, we need to 
* do an internal search for the quote to ensure there is not already one started with that information
* run DCS Household Drivers API In order to get the named insured date of birth, address, verify DL, etc.. from DCS
  * DCS information is stored in Aime/workspace/requirements/TpaManager/Dcs
  * I need you to be able to read the binary files and/or convert them so you can read them.
  * For this and other integrations, we need to be able to accomodate the following architecture:
    * End user needs a list of third party integrations to choose from
      * When selecting an integration, they can set the
        * endpoint url
        * credentials
        * see a list of each node and description
          * later on we will need to be able to map other table values to these nodes, so having access to the nodes is important overall.
      * The ability to enable and disable the integrations on the program level.
    * integrations will need to use the communication system.
      * The communication system will be responsible for all sms, email, api calls, since technically they all use an API call.
      * The these requests and responses need to be secure
      * The end user will need to have access to the responses at some point

Go over all of this, look over all esicsting requirements and determine the best route. If there are areas of question, let's go through it.

Put everything in a file and do not execute any further.
