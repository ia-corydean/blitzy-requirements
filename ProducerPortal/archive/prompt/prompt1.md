I have entered requirements in /workspace/requirements/ProducerPortal/queue/pending

The completed requirements for IP269-Quote-Search are in Aime/workspace/requirements/ProducerPortal/queue/completed

Use the following files to tell me what the next step is:
* /workspace/requirements/ProducerPortal/queue/README.md
* /workspace/requirements/ProducerPortal/setup-complete.md

Also keep in mind, there are going to be instances in these requirements where third party integrations are required.
* We need to ensure these integrations and any supporting tables, schemas, technoologies are outlined when appropriate.
