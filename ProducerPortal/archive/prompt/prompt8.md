* lets not worry about licensing right now
* dont output laravel code as we are validating conepts at this point.

1.2 Component Architecture Design
* this needs to be as simple as possible.
* we just need to be able to associate backendend functionality with frontend functionlity
* this will be used for security groups as well to have access.
* based on the above, what would be the suggestion?

2.2 Enhanced Configuration Architecture
* this needs to be as simple as possible
* think system configration, entity configuration, program configuration,
* we need something that is systematic and flexible

3.3 Recommended ENUM Conversion Strategy
* Phase 1: Convert High-Value ENUMs (Immediate)
* I just feel like using ENUM's in general are not standardized enough and may be a result of over-complexity
* I'm normally seeign enums that are a result of not properly using the _type table
* what are your thouhts?

4.2 Hybrid Business Context Architecture
* this whole business context might be overkill
* all we need to do is simply associate the communication with the one or many of the followoing
  * policy_id, loss_id, claimant_id, entity_id, bank_id, etc..
