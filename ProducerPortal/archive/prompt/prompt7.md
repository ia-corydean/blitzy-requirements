## 2. Clarification Questions for User

### 2.1 Feature Management System Scope

**Questions**:
* **Licensing Model**: What licensing tiers should we support? (Basic, Standard, Premium, Enterprise?)
  * We are going to license the system as an all in one auto insurance platform with insured portal, producer portal, underwriting, claims, fnol, program manager, etc..
  * Eventually we will look to license out these components.
  * For now this should be kept in mind, but treated as a single licensed system.
* **Feature Granularity**: Should features be at the module level (e.g., "Integration Management") or function level (e.g., "DCS Driver Verification")?
  * maybe we should have component and component_type for main parts of the system and feature and feature_type as features of those components.
* **Feature Dependencies**: Do we need to support feature prerequisites? (e.g., "Advanced Reporting" requires "Basic Reporting")
  * maybe this is handles in our decision above?
* **License Management**: Should license management be part of this system or external?
  * See answer above.

**Context**: This will determine the complexity of the feature management system and how it integrates with the entity management architecture.

### 2.2 Configuration Inheritance Preference

**Questions**:
* **Inheritance Complexity**: Do you prefer explicit parent-child relationships or implicit scope-based hierarchy?
  * what would be the best route here?
* **Multiple Inheritance**: Should a configuration be able to inherit from multiple parents?
  * what would be the best route here?
* **Override Granularity**: Should inheritance work at the whole configuration level or individual key level?
  * what would be the best route here?

**Options**:
* **Simple**: System → Program → Producer → Entity (implicit hierarchy)
* **Complex**: Explicit parent-child with multiple inheritance support
  * normally there is going to be system level configuration that carries over into the program configuration
  * the program configuration carries over into the producer configuration and policy configuration
  * entites can be system entites and program entites

### 2.3 ENUM vs Reference Table Trade-offs

**Questions**:
* **Performance vs Flexibility**: Are you willing to accept additional JOIN complexity for better flexibility?
  * Can we accomplish mitigating join complexity by leveraging laravel technologies?
* **Management Overhead**: Should all ENUMs become tables, or only the ones that might need extension?
  * what would be best for now?
* **Migration Strategy**: Should we convert existing ENUMs gradually or all at once?
  * what would be best for now?

**Recommendation**: Convert ENUMs that are likely to be extended (communication channels, entity categories) but keep simple ENUMs for rarely-changing values (boolean-like states).

### 2.4 Business Context Linking Pattern

**Questions**:
* **Polymorphic Relationships**: Are you comfortable with polymorphic patterns (type + id) or prefer explicit relationships?
  * yes to both.
* **Context Complexity**: Should we support multiple business contexts per communication (e.g., communication about both quote and driver)?
  * As long as they can be tracked back to the specific entity or driver or claimant in the system.
* **Future Contexts**: What other business contexts might we need beyond quote/driver/policy?

**Options**:
* **Polymorphic**: Single type/id pair per communication
  * I like this.
* **Context Table**: Many-to-many relationship supporting multiple contexts
  * I fell ike this would be appropirate too.
* **Explicit FKs**: Keep current approach but improve with better organization
  * I feel like it should be a combination of all 3? I dont know. What are your thoughts?
