- Add and manage drivers,
- Handle violations and license status,
- Ensure underwriting rules and validations are enforced.

3. Make changes and save

### **3. Driver List Presentation**

    - If the system has been configured without the ability to remove drivers, this section will be removed and the CTA will shift up to eliminate unexpected white space
- The user can search the list using the search bar to expedite finding the relevant drivers
- The list of drivers will be paginated, and the user can click to show additional drivers
- The household search will run again when the user adds drivers manually, which may result in additional new drivers being returned
    - These drivers will be returned with a “New” tag to differentiate from other drivers in the list
