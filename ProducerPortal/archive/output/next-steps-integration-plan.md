## Universal Entity Management Integration

### Processing Requirements with External Entities
When processing requirements that involve external entities (APIs, attorneys, body shops, vendors):

1. **Entity Identification**: 
   - Review requirement for any external system interactions
   - Categorize entities: INTEGRATION, PARTNER, VENDOR, SYSTEM
   - Determine if entity types already exist or need definition

2. **Universal Pattern Application**:
   - Use universal entity/entity_type pattern for all external entities
   - Apply polymorphic communication for external interactions
   - Configure scope-based settings (system/program/entity)
   - Implement component-based security

3. **Template Selection**:
   - Use universal-requirement-template.md for requirements with external entities
   - Use standard template for internal business logic only
   - Hybrid approach for requirements with both internal and external components

4. **Quality Gates Enhancement**:
   - [ ] Universal entity patterns applied where appropriate
   - [ ] Entity type JSON schemas defined and validated
   - [ ] Communication patterns follow polymorphic source/target model
   - [ ] Configuration hierarchy properly scoped
   - [ ] Component-based security implemented
   - [ ] Global Requirements alignment verified
   - [ ] Performance targets defined and measurable
