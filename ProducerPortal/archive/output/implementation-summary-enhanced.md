## Technical Architecture Implemented

### Core Tables Structure
```sql
-- Universal Entity Management
entity_category (INTEGRATION, PARTNER, VENDOR, SYSTEM)
entity_type (with JSON schemas for DCS APIs)
entity (all DCS API instances)

-- Communication System  
communication (polymorphic source/target with correlation IDs)
communication_type (DCS_DRIVER_LOOKUP, DCS_VEHICLE_LOOKUP, etc.)
communication_channel (DCS_API, DCS_BATCH, DCS_WEBHOOK)
communication_status (DCS_PENDING, DCS_SUCCESS, DCS_FAILED, etc.)

-- Configuration Management
configuration_type (DCS_SETTINGS, DCS_AUTH, etc.)
configuration (scope hierarchy: system/program/entity)

-- Security Components
system_component (backend/frontend/permission mapping)
system_component_permission (granular access control)
```

### DCS Integration Pattern
```php
// Production-ready DCS integration
$dcsWorkflow = new DcsDriverVerificationWorkflow();
$result = $dcsWorkflow->verifyDriver($driverId, [
    'include_vehicles' => true,
    'include_criminal' => true,
    'correlation_id' => 'quote-123-verification'
]);

// Automatic correlation tracking across all APIs
// Circuit breaker protection per endpoint
// Configuration resolution from entity → program → system
// Comprehensive audit logging with PII masking
```
