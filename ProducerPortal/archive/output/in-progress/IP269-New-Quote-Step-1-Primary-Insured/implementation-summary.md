## Integration Specifications

### DCS Driver Verification Workflow
```
1. User enters license number and state
2. System searches local driver records first
3. If no match found, calls DCS Household Drivers API
4. DCS response processed and validated
5. Driver data merged with quote record
6. Complete audit trail maintained
7. Performance metrics recorded
```
