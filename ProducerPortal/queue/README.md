# Requirements Queue Management

## Overview
This queue system manages the processing of Producer Portal requirements through a standardized workflow. Requirements move through different stages from pending to completion.

## Directory Structure

```
queue/
├── pending/           # Requirements waiting to be processed
├── in-progress/       # Requirements currently being worked on
└── completed/         # Finished requirements with generated sections C & E
```

## Workflow Process

### 1. Adding Requirements to Queue
Place requirement documents in the `pending/` directory:
```bash
# Copy requirement to pending queue
cp /path/to/IP269-Something.md queue/pending/

# Or create symlink to avoid duplication
ln -s /path/to/IP269-Something.md queue/pending/
```

### 2. Processing Requirements

#### Single Requirement Workflow

##### Step 1: Move to In-Progress
```bash
# Move requirement to in-progress
mv queue/pending/IP269-Something.md queue/in-progress/
```

##### Step 2: Create Approach File
Create `queue/in-progress/IP269-Something-approach.md` with:
- Questions requiring clarification
- Suggested implementation approach
- Detailed game plan for approval
- Risk considerations and dependencies

##### Step 3: Review and Approve Approach
- Review approach file with stakeholders
- Iterate based on feedback
- Get explicit approval before proceeding

##### Step 4: Process Requirement (After Approval)
- Generate comprehensive requirement following template
- Include Sections C & E with full technical details
- Add integration specifications if applicable

##### Step 5: Complete and Move to Subdirectory
```bash
# Create requirement-specific subdirectory
mkdir -p queue/completed/IP269-Something/

# Move completed files
mv queue/in-progress/IP269-Something.md queue/completed/IP269-Something/
mv queue/in-progress/IP269-Something-approach.md queue/completed/IP269-Something/
# Create processing notes in completed subdirectory
```

#### Batch Processing
```bash
# Process multiple related requirements
mv queue/pending/IP269-*.md queue/in-progress/

# Identify shared entities across requirements
# Generate consolidated entity definitions
# Process each requirement using shared patterns
```

### 3. File Naming Conventions

#### In Progress
```
queue/in-progress/
├── IP269-Something.md                    # Original requirement
└── IP269-Something-approach.md           # Suggested approach file (NEW)
```

#### Completed
```
queue/completed/
├── IP269-Something/                      # Requirement-specific subdirectory
│   ├── IP269-Something.md                    # Complete consolidated requirement
│   └── IP269-Something-processing-notes.md  # Light processing reference
```

## Architecture Integration

### Global Requirements Alignment
All requirements must align with Global Requirements from:
`/app/workspace/requirements/GlobalRequirements/IndividualRequirements/`

Core references for every requirement:
- **GR-52**: Universal Entity Management
- **GR-04**: Validation & Data Handling  
- **GR-18**: Workflow Requirements
- **GR-44**: Communication Architecture
- **GR-48**: External Integrations Catalog
- **GR-53**: DCS Integration Architecture
- [Additional GRs as applicable]

### Approved Requirements Cross-Reference
Before processing any requirement, review existing approved requirements:
`/app/workspace/requirements/ProducerPortal/approved-requirements/`

Validation steps:
- Check for similar functionality patterns
- Identify reusable entity definitions
- Validate consistency with established approaches
- Document deviations and rationale

### Infrastructure Cross-Reference

## Infrastructure Validation Examples

### Specific Infrastructure Cross-Reference Procedures

#### Database Schema Validation
**Before defining new entities, check:**
```bash
# Check existing models for similar patterns
ls /app/workspace/blitzy-requirements/src/backend/app/Models/
grep -r "class.*Model" /app/workspace/blitzy-requirements/src/backend/app/Models/

# Review existing migrations for table patterns
ls /app/workspace/blitzy-requirements/src/backend/database/migrations/ | grep -E "(policy|user|document|payment)"

# Check existing relationships
grep -r "belongsTo\|hasMany\|hasOne" /app/workspace/blitzy-requirements/src/backend/app/Models/
```

#### API Pattern Validation
**Before defining new endpoints, verify existing patterns:**
```bash
# Check existing API routes
cat /app/workspace/blitzy-requirements/src/backend/routes/api.php
cat /app/workspace/blitzy-requirements/src/backend/routes/portal_api.php

# Review controller patterns
ls /app/workspace/blitzy-requirements/src/backend/app/Http/Controllers/Api/
grep -r "class.*Controller" /app/workspace/blitzy-requirements/src/backend/app/Http/Controllers/
```

#### Service Layer Validation  
**Before implementing business logic, check existing services:**
```bash
# Review existing service patterns
ls /app/workspace/blitzy-requirements/src/backend/app/Services/
cat /app/workspace/blitzy-requirements/src/backend/app/Services/PolicyService.php | head -20
cat /app/workspace/blitzy-requirements/src/backend/app/Services/PaymentService.php | head -20
```

### Concrete Infrastructure Examples

#### Example 1: Policy-Related Requirement
When processing a policy requirement:
1. **Check existing Policy model**: `/app/workspace/blitzy-requirements/src/backend/app/Models/Policy.php`
2. **Review policy migrations**: Look for policy-related migration files
3. **Check PolicyService**: `/app/workspace/blitzy-requirements/src/backend/app/Services/PolicyService.php`
4. **Validate API routes**: Check `portal_api.php` for policy endpoints
5. **Document consistency**: Use existing `map_policy_*` table patterns

#### Example 2: Payment Processing Requirement
When processing payment requirements:
1. **Examine Payment model**: `/app/workspace/blitzy-requirements/src/backend/app/Models/Payment.php`
2. **Review PaymentService**: `/app/workspace/blitzy-requirements/src/backend/app/Services/PaymentService.php`
3. **Check payment types**: Review `payment_method_type` reference table
4. **API integration**: Look for existing payment controller patterns
5. **Transaction handling**: Use existing `transaction` and `map_policy_transaction` patterns

#### Example 3: Document Management Requirement
When processing document requirements:
1. **Study DocumentManager**: `/app/workspace/blitzy-requirements/src/backend/app/Services/DocumentManager.php`
2. **Review Document model**: Check existing document/file relationship patterns
3. **File storage**: Use existing Laravel filesystem abstraction
4. **Access control**: Follow `map_user_document` access patterns
5. **Audit trail**: Use existing `map_document_action` tracking
