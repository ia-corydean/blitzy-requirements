# IP269 - Quotes: Bind - Step 3 & 4: Sign Remotely & Make Payment

## **A) WHY - Vision and Purpose**

This experience facilitates a **fully digital and seamless close-out** of the quoting process by enabling insureds to:

- **Electronically sign documents** required to activate their policy.
- **Make a payment** to bind the policy.
- **Complete their purchase remotely**, without agent or in-person steps.

This experience reduces friction, increases bind rates, and supports a modern, self-serve model for insurance.
