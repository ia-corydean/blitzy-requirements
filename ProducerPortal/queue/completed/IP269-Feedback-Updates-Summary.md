- ✅ **DCS Integration Fields on Driver**
  - Moved `dcs_driver_id`, `dcs_correlation_id` to `driver` table
  - Removed these fields from `map_quote_driver`
  - Added `is_named_insured` boolean to `driver` table

#### **License Relationship Correction**
- ✅ **Driver-License Relationship**
  - Changed from `driver.license_type_id` to proper `license` entity usage
  - Driver references complete `license` record, not just type

---

### **Named Insured Requirement Updates**

#### **Discount Management Restructuring**
- ✅ **Separated Discount Definition and Instance**
  - `discount_type` table for definitions and rules
  - `discount` table for specific discount instances
  - `quote_discount` table for quote-specific discount applications
  - Clearer purpose separation and better data management

#### **Housing Reference Correction**
- ✅ **`housing_type` → `residence_type`**
  - Updated naming for clarity and consistency
  - Updated all references in driver entity

#### **Prior Insurance Optimization**
- ✅ **Removed Redundant Boolean**
  - Removed `has_prior_insurance` boolean field
  - Presence of company_name indicates prior insurance exists
  - Changed `policy_number` to `policy_id` for proper foreign key reference

#### **Occupation Structure**
- ✅ **Proper Occupation Entity Structure**
  - `occupation` table for specific occupation instances
  - `occupation_type` table for classification
  - Driver references `occupation_id` instead of varchar field

---

### **Drivers Requirement Updates**

#### **Violation Management Complete Restructure**
- ✅ **Three-Table Violation System**
  - `violation` table: All available violations in system
  - `violation_type` table: Classification (major, minor, DUI, etc.)
  - `driver_violations` table: Driver-specific violation instances
  - `map_entity_violation` table: Maps DCS violations to system violations

#### **Field Placement Corrections**
- ✅ **Driver Entity Centralization**
  - Moved `relationship_to_insured_id` to `driver` table
  - Use existing `driver_type` table for included/excluded/removed status
  - Removed redundant enum from map table

#### **Occupation Reference Consistency**
- ✅ **Occupation ID Reference**
  - Changed from varchar `occupation` field to `occupation_id` foreign key
  - Consistent with occupation table structure from Named Insured step

#### **Removal Reason Management**
- ✅ **Predefined Removal Reasons**
  - Created `removal_reason` reference table
  - Replaced TEXT field with foreign key reference
  - Removed unnecessary `exclusion_reason` field

---

### **Vehicles Requirement Updates**

#### **Universal Entity Management for Owners**
- ✅ **Entity-Based Owner Management**
  - Use `entity` and `entity_type` tables for owners/lienholders/lessees
  - Single flexible system for all ownership types
  - Removed separate `vehicle_owner` table
  - `map_vehicle_owner.vehicle_owner_entity_id` references `entity.id`

#### **Source Entity Consistency**
- ✅ **Standardized External Source References**
  - Changed `external_source_id` to `source_entity_id`
  - Consistent reference to DCS entities across system
  - Applied to both vehicle and entity tables

#### **Vehicle Field Placement**
- ✅ **Core Vehicle Data on Vehicle Table**
  - Moved `usage_type_id`, `garaging_address_id`, `annual_mileage` to `vehicle` table
  - Simplified `map_quote_vehicle` to essential relationship only
  - Better data organization and performance

#### **Commercial Use Field Removal**
- ✅ **Usage Type Simplification**
  - Removed `commercial_use` boolean from `vehicle_usage_type`
  - Commercial use handled as separate usage type entries
  - Cleaner type system without redundant boolean

#### **Ownership Percentage Removal**
- ✅ **Simplified Ownership Model**
  - Removed `ownership_percentage` field
  - Focus on primary ownership relationships
  - Reduced complexity for MVP scope

## Architecture Improvements

### **Universal Entity Management Integration**
- Leveraged existing `entity` and `entity_type` tables for vehicle owners
- Consistent approach for external entities (DCS, owners, lienholders)
- Reduced table proliferation while maintaining flexibility

### **Reference Table Consistency**
- All lookup data properly structured as reference tables
- Consistent naming patterns (`_type` suffix for classifications)
- Proper foreign key relationships throughout

### **Data Normalization**
- Moved descriptive data to core entity tables
- Reduced redundancy in relationship tables
- Better performance and maintainability

### **Naming Convention Adherence**
- Fixed map table naming (`map_program_producer` vs `producer_program`)
- Consistent entity naming (`residence_type` vs `housing_type`)
- Aligned with established infrastructure patterns

## Database Schema Impact Summary

### **New Tables Created**
- `map_program_producer` (renamed from producer_program)

- `map_entity_violation` (DCS violation mapping)
- `removal_reason` (predefined removal reasons)
- `discount` (discount instances)
- `occupation` (occupation details)

### **Modified Tables**
- `driver`: Added relationship, DCS, and occupation fields
