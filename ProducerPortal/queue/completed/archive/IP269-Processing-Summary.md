## Technical Architecture Summary

### **Global Requirements Compliance**
All requirements fully align with applicable Global Requirements:
- **GR-52**: Universal Entity Management for all external integrations
- **GR-53**: DCS Integration Architecture with consistent patterns
- **GR-44**: Communication Architecture for tracking and verification
- **GR-04**: Validation & Data Handling for business rules
- **GR-36**: Authentication & Permissions via Laravel Sanctum
- **GR-33**: Data Services patterns for performance optimization

### **Cross-Step Integration Patterns**
- **Step 1 → All Steps**: Quote creation, DCS data population, producer context
- **Step 1 → Named Insured**: DCS data review and enhancement
- **Steps 1-2 → Drivers**: Household data selection and driver status management
- **Steps 1-3 → Vehicles**: Address data, driver roster, owner verification

### **Infrastructure Integration**
- Existing Laravel codebase patterns leveraged and extended
- Database schema consistency maintained with infrastructure
- API patterns aligned with existing `portal_api.php` endpoints
- Service layer integration with existing business logic

### **Stakeholder Decisions Incorporated**
- Immediate quote creation at Step 1 start
- DCS-only search (no internal database search)
- Direct storage approach (no caching needed)
- Producer always attached to quote
- Data persistence across workflow steps

## Database Schema Impact

### **New Core Tables**
- `quote` - Central quote entity with immediate creation
- `prior_insurance` - Prior insurance tracking
- `driver_violation` - Individual violation management
- `vehicle_owner` - Vehicle ownership tracking

### **New Reference Tables**
- `license_type`, `gender`, `marital_status`, `housing_type`
- `relationship_to_insured`, `employment_status`, `violation_type`, `sr22_reason`
- `discount_type`, `vehicle_usage_type`

### **New Relationship Tables**
- `map_quote_driver`, `map_quote_vehicle`
- `quote_discount_eligibility`, `map_vehicle_owner`, `map_vehicle_driver`
- `producer_program`

### **Modified Existing Tables**
- `driver` - Enhanced with DCS integration, employment, and compliance fields
- `vehicle` - Fixed typo, added DCS integration and garaging address
- `program` - Added availability and effective date configuration

## External Integration Summary

### **DCS API Integrations (GR-53)**
- **DCS_HOUSEHOLD_DRIVERS**: Primary insured search and household lookup
- **DCS_HOUSEHOLD_VEHICLES**: Vehicle lookup by address association
- **DCS_CRIMINAL**: Criminal background eligibility checking

### **Supporting Service Integrations**
- **Email Verification**: Contact verification with fallback patterns
- **Phone Verification**: SMS/voice verification capabilities
- **VIN Decoder**: Vehicle specification lookup with manual fallback

### **Circuit Breaker Patterns**
All external services implement:
- 5 failure threshold with 60-second timeout
- Graceful degradation to manual entry
- Comprehensive fallback strategies
- PII masking in communication logs

## Performance Characteristics

### **Response Time Targets**
- Quote creation: < 500ms
- DCS searches: < 5-10 seconds (pending stakeholder clarification)
- VIN decoding: < 3 seconds
- Business rule validation: < 200ms
- Auto-save operations: < 500ms with debouncing

### **Data Persistence Strategy**
- Direct entity storage (no caching per stakeholder)
- Cross-step data propagation
- Optimistic UI updates with rollback
- Progress persistence across workflow interruptions
