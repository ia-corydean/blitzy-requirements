## Updated Implementation Approach

### Overview (Based on Cross-Requirement Decisions)
Implement vehicle management that builds on completed driver selection (Step 2) and established DCS integration patterns (Step 1). The system leverages existing driver data for vehicle assignment and follows proven data persistence patterns.

### Entity Strategy
**Entities to reuse from infrastructure:**
- `vehicle` - Core vehicle information (existing model with modal typo)
- `address` - For garaging address  
- `map_quote_vehicle` - Quote-vehicle association
- All vehicle reference tables (make, model, usage_type)

**New entities needed:**
- `vehicle_owner` - Track registered owners  
- `map_vehicle_owner` - Vehicle-owner relationships
- `map_vehicle_driver` - Vehicle-to-driver assignments (primary driver)
- `vehicle_lookup_result` - Cache DCS lookup results

**Driver integration:**
- Link vehicles to drivers from Step 2 completed roster
- Vehicle ownership verification against existing drivers
- Primary driver assignment from available driver pool

### Integration Approach (Based on Established Patterns)
**External services building on Step 1:**
1. **DCS Vehicle Lookup** (GR-53)
   - Use same household address from Step 1 driver search
   - Follow established DCS authentication patterns
   - Return VIN, year, make, model with same data persistence approach
   
2. **VIN Decoder Service** 
   - Full vehicle specifications using Universal Entity Management (GR-52)
   - Validate VIN format
   - Cache results following no-caching clarification from stakeholders
   
3. **Vehicle History Service** (Optional)
   - Accident/claim history
   - Title status  
   - Ownership transfers

**Integration patterns consistent with previous steps:**
- DCS household lookup following Step 1 patterns
- Direct entity storage (no caching per stakeholder decision)
- Manual addition workflow when DCS doesn't find all vehicles

### Workflow Considerations (Cross-Step Integration)
**State transitions building on previous steps:**
1. From DRIVERS_COMPLETE (Step 2 completed with driver roster)
2. DCS vehicle lookup using Step 1 address data
3. Vehicle selection and driver assignment from Step 2 roster
4. Owner validation against existing drivers
5. Manual vehicle addition when DCS incomplete
6. Update to VEHICLES_COMPLETE

**Validation points:**
- VIN format and checksum
- Owner verification against Step 2 driver roster
- Primary driver assignment from available drivers
- Usage type required
- Garaging address validation
- License plate format by state

**Error handling consistent with previous steps:**
- Clear messages for invalid VINs
- Owner addition triggers Step 2-style driver addition workflow
- Graceful handling of DCS lookup failures with manual fallback

## Detailed Game Plan

### Step 1: Entity Analysis
1. Design vehicle owner tracking
2. Determine garaging address approach
3. Plan vehicle lookup caching
4. Review existing vehicle schema adequacy

### Step 2: Global Requirements Alignment
**Primary GRs to apply:**
- **GR-53**: DCS Integration (vehicle lookup)
- **GR-52**: Universal Entity Management (VIN decoder)
- **GR-04**: Validation & Data Handling (VIN/plate validation)
- **GR-18**: Workflow Requirements (owner addition flow)
- **GR-07**: Reusable Components (vehicle cards, search)
- **GR-20**: Application Business Logic (usage rules)

### Step 3: Backend Implementation (Section C)
1. **Vehicle Lookup API Building on Step 1**
   - GET /api/v1/quotes/{id}/vehicle-lookup
   - Use household address from Step 1 DCS data
   - Return vehicle list with DCS integration patterns
   
2. **VIN Decoder API**
   - POST /api/v1/vehicles/decode-vin
   - Full vehicle specifications
   - Direct storage (no caching per stakeholder decision)
   
3. **Add Vehicle APIs with Driver Integration**
   - POST /api/v1/quotes/{id}/vehicles
   - Support VIN and YMM entry
   - Validate ownership against Step 2 driver roster
   
4. **Driver Assignment Management**
   - PUT /api/v1/quotes/{id}/vehicles/{vehicleId}/driver
   - Assign primary driver from Step 2 roster
   - Trigger driver addition workflow if owner not found

### Step 4: Database Schema (Section E)
1. **New Tables:**
   - `vehicle_owner` with name, relationship  
   - `map_vehicle_owner` associations
   - `map_vehicle_driver` for primary driver assignments (links to Step 2 drivers)
   - `vehicle_lookup_result` for DCS results (direct storage per stakeholder)
   
2. **Modifications:**
   - Fix `modal` typo to `model` in existing vehicle table
   - Add usage_type_id to map_quote_vehicle
   - Add garaging_address_id
   - Ensure vehicle has all decode fields

3. **Driver Integration:**
   - Link vehicle ownership to Step 2 driver roster
   - Primary driver assignment from completed driver data
   - Owner validation against existing drivers

### Step 5: Quality Validation
1. Test VIN decoder accuracy
2. Verify owner validation flow
3. Test address-based lookup
4. Validate YMM search functionality
5. Confirm all usage types

## Risk Considerations

### Technical Risks

3. **Owner Data Quality**: Registration data may be outdated

### Business Risks
1. **Missing Vehicles**: Household lookup incomplete
2. **Ownership Disputes**: Complex ownership scenarios
3. **Coverage Gaps**: Vehicles not properly added

### Mitigation Strategies
- Allow manual override for all lookups
- Clear ownership documentation requirements
- Comprehensive vehicle search options
- Audit trail for all additions

## Dependencies
- VIN decoder service selection
- Complete usage type definitions
- Owner validation rules
- Address matching algorithm
