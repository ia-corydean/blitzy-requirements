* we need to update our process to account for the architecture in Aime/workspace/requirements
* we need to also account for approved-requirements directory as another reference point in the claude and read me files to gather supporting context and information for the requirements its working on.
  * example is Aime/workspace/requirements/ProducerPortal/approved-requirements
* we need to ensure we always cross reference Aime/workspace/blitzy-requirements for exisiting infrastructure.
  * We need to always do a git update or pull request here to ensure it's up to date.
  * https://github.com/blitzy-public-samples/insure-pilot-new.git staging branch
  * blitzy-requirements directory is currently pointed at a github repo that is incorrect and needs to be corrected with I just provided.
