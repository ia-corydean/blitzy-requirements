# Execution Plan: Update Process Documentation and Infrastructure Integration

## Overview
Update our requirements process documentation to include comprehensive reference architecture, approved requirements directory integration, and ensure proper cross-referencing with existing infrastructure through git repository management.

## Current State Analysis
- **Requirements Architecture**: Located at `/app/workspace/requirements` with GlobalRequirements and ProducerPortal
- **Approved Requirements**: Directory exists at `/app/workspace/requirements/ProducerPortal/approved-requirements` with IP269-Quotes-Search.md
- **Blitzy Requirements**: Directory doesn't exist yet, needs to be created/linked to staging branch of https://github.com/blitzy-public-samples/insure-pilot-new.git
- **Documentation**: CLAUDE.md and README.md files need updates to reference new architecture

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
1. **Create Blitzy Requirements Directory**
   - Clone staging branch from https://github.com/blitzy-public-samples/insure-pilot-new.git
   - Set up as `/app/workspace/blitzy-requirements`
   - Create update procedures

2. **Verify Repository Connection**
   - Test git pull/update functionality
   - Document access patterns
   - Create maintenance procedures

### Phase 2: Update Process Documentation

#### Update Queue README.md
Add comprehensive sections:

```markdown
## Architecture Integration

### Global Requirements Alignment
All requirements must align with Global Requirements from:
`/app/workspace/requirements/GlobalRequirements/IndividualRequirements/`

Core references for every requirement:
- GR-52: Universal Entity Management
- GR-04: Validation & Data Handling  
- GR-18: Workflow Requirements
- [Additional GRs as applicable]

### Approved Requirements Cross-Reference
Before processing any requirement, review existing approved requirements:
`/app/workspace/requirements/ProducerPortal/approved-requirements/`

Validation steps:
- Check for similar functionality patterns
- Identify reusable entity definitions
- Validate consistency with established approaches
- Document deviations and rationale

### Infrastructure Cross-Reference
Mandatory verification against existing codebase:
`/app/workspace/blitzy-requirements/` (staging branch)

Pre-processing checklist:
- [ ] Git repository updated (git pull)
- [ ] Existing entity models reviewed
- [ ] Database schema consistency verified
- [ ] API patterns identified for reuse
- [ ] Service layer integration points documented

### Git Update Procedures
Before starting any requirement analysis:
```bash
cd /app/workspace/blitzy-requirements
git checkout staging
git pull origin staging
```
```

#### Update Approach File Process
Enhance approach file requirements:

```markdown
## Enhanced Approach File Requirements

Each approach file must include:

### Infrastructure Review Section
- [ ] Existing codebase patterns identified
- [ ] Database schema impacts assessed
- [ ] Service layer modifications documented
- [ ] API consistency verified
- [ ] Migration requirements identified

### Approved Requirements Alignment
- [ ] Similar requirements reviewed
- [ ] Pattern reuse validated
- [ ] Consistency maintained
- [ ] Deviations justified

### Global Requirements Compliance

```

### Phase 3: Update CLAUDE.md Files

#### ProducerPortal CLAUDE.md Updates
Add sections:

```markdown
## Reference Architecture Integration

### Global Requirements Foundation
All ProducerPortal requirements build upon Global Requirements:
`/app/workspace/requirements/GlobalRequirements/IndividualRequirements/`

### Approved Requirements Library
Established patterns available at:
`/app/workspace/requirements/ProducerPortal/approved-requirements/`

Use approved requirements for:

### Git Integration Workflow
Ensure repository currency:
1. Update local repository before analysis
2. Review existing implementations
3. Document integration points
4. Validate against current architecture
```

#### Global CLAUDE.md Updates
Add comprehensive architecture references:

```markdown
## Complete Architecture Integration

### Repository Structure

- **Approved Requirements**: `/app/workspace/requirements/[Domain]/approved-requirements/`
- **Infrastructure Codebase**: `/app/workspace/blitzy-requirements/` (staging)

### Cross-Reference Standards
Every requirement must verify against:
1. Applicable Global Requirements
2. Domain-specific approved requirements  
3. Existing infrastructure patterns
4. Current codebase implementations

### Quality Assurance Integration
Enhanced quality gates include:
- [ ] Global Requirements compliance verified
