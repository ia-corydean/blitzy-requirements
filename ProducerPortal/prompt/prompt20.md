Update the process in README.md
* In the completed section, although we are only creating 2 files per requirement, these files should be placed in a subdirectory that is specfiic to that requirement.
  * example IP269-New-Quote-Step-1-Named-Insured.md files would go in /completed/IP269-New-Quote-Step-1-Named-Insured/
* after analysis of what all needs to be done for each requirement and before any files are added, updated, moved, etcc..
  * A suggested approach file should be created for each requirement file that serves as a buffer to:
    * ask questions that may need to be answered to proplerly finish the requirement
    * outline suggested approaches for approval
    * outline the game plan for that requirement, overall, for approval before any files are actually modified.
    * Upon iteration and approval of these should we proceed to actually changing or updating anything.
