## ADR-001: Map Table Approach for Suspenses
**Date**: 2024-01-30  
**Status**: ✅ Accepted  
**Requirement**: IP269-Quotes-Search

### Context
Need to associate suspenses with multiple entity types (quotes, policies, losses) while maintaining clean database design.

### Decision
Use separate map tables (`map_quote_suspense`, `map_policy_suspense`, `map_loss_suspense`) instead of polymorphic relationships.

### Rationale
- Cleaner, more explicit queries
- Better database performance with proper indexing
- Easier to maintain foreign key constraints
- Follows established patterns in the codebase

### Consequences
- More tables to maintain
- Need separate queries for each entity type
- But: Better performance and maintainability

**Requirement**: IP269-Quotes-Search

### Context
Different MGAs have different driver classification needs (included, excluded, listed-only, etc.).

### Decision
Use `driver_type` reference table with business logic in application layer, not database constraints.

### Rationale
- Flexible for MGA-specific requirements
- Simple database structure
- Business rules can evolve without schema changes
- Consistent with other reference table patterns

### Consequences

### Context
Need to implement third-party integrations (DCS API) and internal quote duplication checking while maintaining consistency with existing platform architecture.

### Decision
Extend existing Apache Camel integration platform (Global Requirement 48) and CommunicationService patterns (Global Requirement 44) rather than build custom integration layer.

### Rationale
- Reuses proven patterns from global requirements
- Maintains consistency across platform
- Reduces development time and maintenance overhead
- Leverages existing security, monitoring, and error handling

### Consequences

### Rationale
- Enables complex queries on mapping structure
- Supports flexible business logic transformations
- Allows for versioning and auditability
- JSON provides needed flexibility without schema changes

### Rationale
- Supports enterprise requirements for granular control
- Allows system defaults with program/producer customization
- Scales from simple to complex deployment scenarios
- Clear precedence rules prevent configuration conflicts

### Decision
Use `is_named_insured` boolean on `driver` table, not in map tables.

### Rationale
- Simple and direct relationship
- Easy to query
- Can enforce business rule of single named insured
- Avoids complex join patterns

### Consequences
- Must ensure only one driver per quote has `is_named_insured = true`
- But: Simpler queries and data integrity

### Rationale
- Consistent pattern across all tables
- Flexible status definitions
- Better reporting capabilities
- Aligns with existing global requirements

### Rationale
- Characteristics belong to the entity, not the relationship
- Simpler queries and better performance
- Reusable across different contexts
- More normalized design

### Consequences
- Entity tables are larger
- But: Better normalization and reusability

### Decision
Use `created_at` for quote submission, remove `submitted_at` field.

### Rationale
- Simpler schema
- Quote creation IS submission in this context
- Consistent with other entity patterns
- Reduces redundant timestamp fields

### Consequences

## ADR-026: Database Entity Naming Conventions
**Date**: 2025-01-07  
**Status**: ✅ Accepted  
**Source**: Infrastructure Analysis from blitzy-requirements

### Context
Analysis of existing models reveals established naming patterns that should be maintained.

### Decision
Follow existing entity naming conventions:
