I want to go through the process of generating DCS global requirements with the new process defined in Aime/workspace/requirements/README.md
- All of the current documentation is in Aime/workspace/requirements/EntityIntigration/Dcs
    - Analyze these as a starting point for what we are trying to accomplish and some previous decisions that may have already been made.
    - Based off of that, create an initial file in processing-queues/entity-integration/pending that outlines the starting the starting point and what are trying to accomplish
        - do not execute past that and use this as an approval stage for whaere we are and what we are about to do.
