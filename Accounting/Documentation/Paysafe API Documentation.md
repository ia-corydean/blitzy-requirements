## **1\. Introduction**

All third-party integrations must be fully data-driven, version-aware, and auditable. Endpoints, credentials, and feature-flags live exclusively in encrypted database tables—never in code. This document details how to integrate the Paysafe Payments API under these global requirements. Paysafe offers a single REST endpoint for cards, wallets, bank transfers, and 100+ local methods with JSON responses https://developer.paysafe.com/en/api-docs/server-side-sdks-payments-api/php/.

## **2\. Goals & Key Principles**

* **Self-Service Onboarding:** Admin UI only—no code deployments.

* **Program-Centric Control:** Each insurance Program maps to specific payment flows (e.g. “authorize”, “capture”).

* **Audit-First Invocation:** Every call logs:

* **Config-Driven Flexibility:**

* **Modular Reuse:** Flows remapped via map tables—no duplication.

* **Permission-First:** Component keys are permission slugs; enforced by roles & gates.

## **8\. Partial Installment Payment Process** 

**Recalculate Balance:**

 ini  
CopyEdit  
`Remaining = installment total – installment paid`

1.   
2. **Update Status:**

   * If `paid == total`: `status_id = Paid`.

   * If `0 < paid < total`: `status_id = Partially Paid`.

3. **Record Transaction:**

   * Link payment via `map_policy_installment_transaction` with audit fields.

4. **Recalculate Policy Balances:**

   * Update Net Premium Remaining \= (Total Premium \+ Fees) – Payments Applied.

   * Influences future installment calculations.

## **9\. Real-Time Payment Processing**

1. **Receive Payment Request:**

   * API endpoint captures `amount`, `method`, etc.; validated via Laravel Requests.

2. **Immediate Transaction Recording:**

   * Insert `transaction` record

3. **Update Balances:**

   * For installments: update `paid`, recalc remaining; if fully paid → generate next installment.

   * For premium/fees: adjust totals via mapping tables.

4. **Real-Time Recalc:**

   * Recompute Net Premium Remaining; trigger new installment if needed.

5. **Logging & Notifications:**

   * Log transaction & status; notify if status changes (e.g. “Paid”).

## **10\. Batch Payments**

1. **Collect Payment Data:**

   * Cronjob aggregates payment transactions since last run via mapping tables.

2. **Aggregate & Reconcile:**

   * Sum debits per policy; reconcile against expected premium/fee.

3. **Update Records:**

   * Update Net Premium Remaining; add to installment’s `paid`; mark as “Paid” if complete; schedule next installment.

4. **Generate Reports:**

   * Summarize processed payments, outstanding amounts, discrepancies.

5. **Error Handling:**

   * Log errors; retry failed transactions.

## **11\. Reporting & Data Point Identification**

For each data point, retrieve via mapping tables then source tables.

* **Next Payment Amount**

* **Due Date of Next Payment**

* **Last Payment Amount**

* **Last Payment Transaction ID**

* **Last Payment Date**

* **Installment Status**

* **Current Outstanding Late Fee**

* **Total Term Remaining Balance**

* **Installments Left in Current Term**

* **Installments Made in Current Term**

* **Total Premium Paid in Current Term**

* **Total Premium Left in Current Term**

* **Total Term Premium**

* **Transaction Status**

* **Transaction Type**

* **Transaction Date**

* **Transaction Amount**

* **Transaction Confirmation Number**

* **Routing Number**

* **Account Number**

* **Check Number**

* **Credit Card Number**

* **Expiration Date (MM/YY)**

* **Security Number**

* **Name on Card**

* **Billing Address, City, State, Zip**

* **Form of Payment**

* **Coverage Expiration Date**

* **Total Number of Installments for the Term**

## **14\. Why This Design?**

* **Zero-Code Onboarding:** UI & mapping tables handle all config.

* **Program Flexibility:** Each program dictates exactly which payment flows run.

* **End-to-End Audit Trail:** `communication` \+ map tables ensure traceability.

* **Configurable & Upgrade-Ready:** YAML-driven fields simplify version upgrades.

* **Developer Ergonomics:** Clear Contracts, Adapters, and typed DTOs.

* **Extensible & Secure:** New payment methods or versions require only new YAML \+ DB rows; secrets remain encrypted.

## **Macro-Level Verification Strategy for Stored Payment Methods**

### **1\. Multi-Layered Verification Architecture**

**Initial Setup Verification (One-Time)**

* When customers first store their payment methods, implement comprehensive validation using Paysafe's verification APIs  
* For credit cards: Perform zero-dollar authorization with automatic $1 authorization fallback for banks that reject $0 transactions  
* For bank accounts: Use Paysafe's Bank Account Validation API with secure customer authentication through their banking credentials  
* Store verification tokens and metadata for future reference

**Ongoing Status Monitoring (Scheduled)**

* Implement periodic verification checks for stored payment methods (weekly/monthly)  
* Monitor for expiration dates approaching within 60-90 days  
* Track failed transaction patterns that might indicate account issues  
* Maintain verification status cache with appropriate TTL

### **2\. Real-Time Pre-Payment Verification Process**

**Account Status Validation**

* Before processing payments, query stored verification status and check cache validity  
* For expired verifications, trigger re-verification workflow  
* Use Paysafe's verification transaction type to confirm account accessibility  
* Implement intelligent fallback when primary verification methods are unavailable

**Comprehensive Error Detection**

* Leverage Paysafe's error response system to categorize different failure types  
* Map Paysafe error codes to your business logic for each scenario (insufficient funds, expired card, etc.)  
* Implement graduated response based on error severity and type  
* Use processor decline codes to determine if issues are temporary or permanent

### **3\. Scenario-Specific Verification Handlers**

**Insufficient Funds Detection**

* Use authorization attempts with immediate void to test account balance availability  
* Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for temporary insufficient fund situations  
* Provide clear customer messaging with alternative payment method suggestions

**Expired Card Management**

* Proactive monitoring of expiration dates in your stored payment data  
* Automated customer notifications 60, 30, and 7 days before expiration  
* Seamless re-verification flow when customers update payment information  
* Integration with card updater services if available through Paysafe

**Transaction Limit Handling**

* Pre-validate transaction amounts against known card limits from previous transactions  
* Implement intelligent amount splitting for transactions exceeding single-transaction limits  
* Use incremental authorization testing to discover limit thresholds  
* Maintain customer-specific limit metadata based on transaction history

**Invalid Card/Account Detection**

* Distinguish between temporarily unavailable accounts and permanently invalid ones  
* Use Paysafe's response codes to determine appropriate retry strategies  
* Implement account health scoring based on recent transaction success patterns  
* Automatic payment method flagging and customer notification workflows

### **4\. Integration with Rating Engine Architecture**

**Verification Data Storage**

* Extend your existing audit-first database schema to include verification status, timestamps, and error history  
* Maintain verification cache aligned with your metadata-driven approach  
* Store verification results in a way that supports your forensic replay requirements

**Business Logic Integration**

* Integrate verification checks into your existing rate calculation sequence  
* Add verification status as a factor in your deterministic payment processing flow  
* Ensure verification failures are properly logged in your transaction audit trail

**Error Recovery Workflows**

* Build verification failure handling into your existing retry and queue management systems  
* Implement customer notification workflows that align with your insurance platform's communication standards  
* Create administrative workflows for handling verification exceptions and manual overrides

### **5\. Operational Excellence**

**Performance Optimization**

* Cache verification results appropriately to minimize API calls while maintaining accuracy  
* Implement batch verification processes for routine account health checks  
* Use asynchronous processing for non-critical verification updates

**Monitoring and Alerting**

* Track verification success rates, response times, and error patterns  
* Implement alerting for unusual verification failure spikes or performance degradation  
* Create dashboards for payment method health across your customer base

**Compliance and Security**

* Ensure all verification processes maintain PCI DSS compliance  
* Implement proper data retention policies for verification logs and cached results  
* Regular security audits of verification workflows and stored verification data

This approach provides comprehensive coverage of all the scenarios you mentioned while maintaining integration with your existing metadata-driven architecture and ensuring optimal customer experience through proactive issue detection and resolution.
