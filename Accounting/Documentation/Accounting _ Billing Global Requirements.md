# **Enhanced Auto Insurance Accounting Microservice \- Macro Architecture**

## **Core Architecture Principles**

**Equity-Based Double-Entry System**: Every transaction maintains the fundamental accounting equation (Assets \= Liabilities \+ Equity) with corresponding debit/credit entries in the transaction\_line table.

**Program-Centric Configuration**: Insurance programs drive all financial rules, adjustments, and processing logic through configurable lookup tables rather than hardcoded business logic.

**Audit-First Design**: Complete financial audit trail with every business event creating traceable journal entries linking back to originating policy actions.

## **Data Model Standards & Conventions**

**Naming Conventions**: All tables use singular names with map\_ prefixes for join tables and \_type suffixes for lookup tables, ensuring consistent schema organization.

**Universal Status Management**: Single status/status\_type model applied across all entities, providing centralized state management with standardized status transitions.

**Comprehensive Audit Trail**: All tables include audit fields (created\_by, created\_at, updated\_by, updated\_at) maintaining complete change history for regulatory compliance.

**Metadata-Driven Architecture**: Extensive use of lookup and mapping tables enabling business rule configuration without code deployment.

## **Primary Data Architecture**

**Transaction Header Model**: Central transaction table capturing business event metadata (policy reference, effective dates, transaction types, status).

**Transaction Line Detail Model**: Granular debit/credit entries with account classifications, amounts, and linkages to specific business components (premiums, fees, adjustments).

**Dynamic Installment Management**: Just-in-time installment generation triggered by payment events rather than batch processing, maintaining real-time payment scheduling.

## **Payment Plan Framework**

**Flexible Down-Payment Calculation**: Support for percentage-based, date-driven, and paid-in-full scenarios with configurable program-specific rules.

**Multi-Component Installment Structure**: Each installment decomposes into premium slices (calculated via daily rates), policy fees, regulatory fees (MCVPA, SR22), and installment charges.

**Intelligent Payment Allocation**: Single payments can span multiple installments with oldest-first application logic, automatically triggering next installment creation upon full payment completion.

## **Enhanced Payment Method Verification Framework**
