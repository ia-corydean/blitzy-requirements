- External System Integration 
  - General ledger system interfaces 
    - not for now, but our own internal system should be able to support this when we are ready.
  - Commission payment systems
    - not for now, but our own internal system should be able to support this when we are ready.
  - Document management integration
    - We have our own outlined in requirements
  - Communication system for notices
    - we have our own outliend in requirements.
  - Regulatory reporting interfaces
    - own internal system should be able to support this when we are ready.

- Small Refund Threshold: What dollar amount is considered a "small refund" that should be prevented through cancellation date adjustment?
  - This should be configurable in the program manager
- Date Adjustment Limits: How many days can the cancellation date be adjusted to prevent refunds?

  - Explain?
- Override Structure: Should the system support override commissions where agency principals earn a percentage of their agents' commissions?
  - Explain?
- How many levels of agency hierarchy need commission support?
  - Suggestion?
  - See if the individual global requirements help answer this.
- Override Rates: Are override commission rates program-specific or agency-specific?
  - Technically, both.
  - Program level defines the commission rates available for producers, including special.
  - Agent can then be assigned the default or special commission available on the program they can write.

  - Yes. The gateway should be set on the program and technically different prgrams can have different gateways.
  - Each program should be able to support a main gateway and a fallback gateway.

  - It should be a configuration in the prgram manager.
- Alternative Payment Methods: Which specific alternative payment methods should be gateway-supported?
  - Explain?

  - Explain?

- ensure that we are not over-complicating the accounting foundation.
