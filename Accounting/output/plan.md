# Accounting Global Requirements Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary
This plan outlines the creation of comprehensive Accounting Global Requirements for the personal auto insurance system. Based on analysis of existing documentation, architectural patterns, and global requirements, I will create a structured set of requirements that align with the established system architecture while providing a robust financial management foundation.

## 1. Analysis Summary

### 1.1 Documentation Review Findings
From the Accounting Documentation analysis, the system requires:
- **Equity-based double-entry accounting system** with complete audit trails
- **Program-centric configuration** using lookup tables (no hardcoded business logic)
- **Complex transaction management** with headers and line details
- **Flexible payment plans** with dynamic installment generation
- **Paysafe integration** for payment processing with comprehensive error handling
- **Multi-level adjustment workflows** for premiums, fees, discounts, and commissions
- **Real-time financial reporting** directly from transaction tables
- **PCI DSS compliance** and 7-year retention for regulatory requirements

### 1.2 Architectural Alignment
Based on architectural decisions and entity catalog review:
- **Universal Entity Management** (GR-52) patterns for external payment providers
- **Laravel 12.x/PHP 8.4+** infrastructure with MariaDB and Redis
- **Service layer architecture** with dedicated AccountingService classes
- **Event-driven messaging** (GR-49) for payment workflows
- **Communication patterns** (GR-44) for payment notifications
- **Three-level configuration hierarchy** (system → program → entity)

### 1.3 Key Integration Points
- **Payment Gateway Integration**: Paysafe as universal entity with JSON metadata
- **Producer Payment Integration**: ACH/check processing for commissions
- **Document Management**: Financial document storage using existing infrastructure
- **Communication Services**: Payment notifications via SendGrid/Twilio
- **Audit System**: Complete financial audit trail with PII protection

## 3. Implementation Approach

### 3.1 File Organization
Create individual requirement files in `/app/workspace/requirements/GlobalRequirements/IndividualRequirements/`:
- Each file follows the established single-file consolidated format
- Include pre-analysis checklist with cross-references
- Define clear Section C (Backend) and Section E (Database) specifications
- Reference existing global requirements appropriately

### 3.2 Database Schema Design
Core accounting tables following GR-41 standards:
- `account` - Chart of accounts
- `journal_entry` - Transaction headers
  - Change to transaction
- `journal_entry_line` - Transaction details
  - Change to transaction_line
- `invoice` - Invoice headers
- `invoice_line` - Invoice line items
- `payment_schedule` - Payment plan definitions
  - change to payment_plan and payment_plan_type
- `payment_allocation` - Payment application tracking
- Reference tables with `_type` suffix
- Map tables with `map_` prefix

### 3.3 Service Architecture
Following established Laravel patterns:
- `AccountingService` - Core accounting operations
- `BillingService` - Billing and invoicing
- `PaymentPlanService` - Payment plan management
- `FinancialReportingService` - Report generation
- `PaymentGatewayService` - External payment integration

### 3.4 Integration Patterns
- Paysafe as universal entity (PAYSAFE_GATEWAY type)
- Apache Camel for payment gateway routing
- Event-driven payment notifications
- HashiCorp Vault for credential management

## 4. Questions Requiring Clarification

### 4.1 Multi-Currency Support
- Is multi-currency support required initially or future consideration?
  - No.
- If required, what currencies beyond USD?
- Exchange rate source and update frequency?

### 4.2 Financial Year Configuration
- Calendar year or configurable fiscal year?
  - Both. Calendar year for typical reporting and treaty term reporting.
- Month-end close requirements and timelines?
  - Suggestions?
- Year-end close special processing?
  - Suggestions?

### 4.3 Commission Structure
- Simple percentage-based or tiered commission structures?
  - we need to account for program specific default commissions for producers as well as special commissions for some producers.
  - commissions are percentage based for now.
- Commission clawback rules for cancellations?
  - Explain?
- Multi-level commission splits?
  - Explain?

### 4.4 Payment Gateway Redundancy
- Single payment gateway (Paysafe) or multiple providers?
  - Paysafe.
- Failover requirements between gateways?
  - No fail-over.
  - Suggestion on what to do for a Paysafe outage?
- Gateway selection rules if multiple?

### 4.5 Accounting Software Integration
- Integration with external accounting software (QuickBooks, etc.)?
  - Not for now, but the infrastrucute should support it in the future.
- Export formats required (CSV, API, specific formats)?
  - Positive Pay exports
    - Aime/workspace/requirements/Accounting/Documentation/ACH NACHA File Specs 8.2.22 conv.html
- Real-time sync or batch export?

## 5. Deliverables

Upon approval, I will create:

1. **Eight Global Requirement Files** (54-61) covering all accounting aspects
2. **Entity Catalog Updates** with new accounting entities
3. **Architectural Decision Records** for key accounting decisions
4. **Integration Specifications** for Paysafe and other external systems
5. **Database Migration Scripts** (conceptual) for accounting tables
6. **Service Interface Definitions** for accounting services

## 6. Success Criteria

The accounting global requirements will be considered successful when they:
- Provide complete double-entry accounting foundation
- Enable configuration-driven business rules without code changes
- Support all premium, fee, and payment scenarios
- Ensure PCI DSS compliance and data security
- Enable real-time financial reporting
- Maintain complete audit trails for compliance
- Integrate seamlessly with existing infrastructure
- Scale to handle high transaction volumes

## 7. Next Steps

1. **Review and approve this plan** with any modifications
2. **Clarify questions** in Section 4 above
3. **Execute plan** creating all requirement files
4. **Review deliverables** for completeness
5. **Update entity catalog** and architectural decisions
6. **Document any new patterns** discovered during implementation

This comprehensive approach ensures the accounting system will be robust, scalable, compliant, and fully integrated with the existing platform architecture.
