# Paysafe Integration Plan - Secure Payment Data Management

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines how to integrate with Paysafe's payment platform to completely avoid storing sensitive payment information like credit card numbers and bank account details on our insurance platform. By leveraging Paysafe's tokenization and secure vault services, we can process payments while maintaining PCI compliance and reducing security risks.

### Key Benefits
- **Zero Storage of Sensitive Data**: No credit card or bank account numbers stored in our database
- **Reduced PCI Compliance Scope**: Significantly simplified compliance requirements
- **Enhanced Security**: Payment data secured by Paysafe's certified infrastructure
- **Flexible Payment Options**: Support for cards, bank accounts, and 100+ payment methods
- **API-Driven Access**: Secure access to payment capabilities through RESTful APIs

## Integration Architecture

### Token-Based Payment Flow

The integration follows a token-replacement strategy where sensitive payment data is immediately exchanged for secure tokens:

1. **Customer Entry Point**: Payment information entered through secure forms
2. **Direct Transmission**: Data sent directly to Paysafe, bypassing our servers
3. **Token Reception**: Paysafe returns a unique token representing the payment method
4. **Local Storage**: Only the token and non-sensitive metadata stored in our system
5. **Payment Processing**: All transactions use tokens through Paysafe's API

### Security Architecture

- **End-to-End Encryption**: Payment data encrypted from customer browser to Paysafe
- **Token Isolation**: Tokens meaningless without Paysafe's secure environment
- **API Authentication**: Secure credentials stored in HashiCorp Vault
- **Audit Trails**: Complete tracking without exposing sensitive data

## Implementation Workflow

### Customer Payment Method Setup

**Initial Registration Process**
1. Customer accesses payment setup through policy portal
2. Secure payment form loads with Paysafe's hosted fields
3. Customer enters credit card or bank account information
4. Data submitted directly to Paysafe via encrypted connection
5. Paysafe validates and stores the payment method
6. Platform receives secure token and validation results
7. Token linked to customer's policy for future use

**Verification Steps**
- Zero-dollar authorization for credit cards
- Bank account validation through secure authentication
- Real-time verification status updates
- Automatic retry for failed verifications

### Payment Processing Flow

**One-Time Payments**
1. Retrieve customer's payment token from local storage
2. Create payment request with token and amount
3. Submit to Paysafe API for processing
4. Receive transaction results and confirmation
5. Update policy payment records with results
6. Send payment confirmation to customer

**Recurring Payments**
1. Schedule payment based on installment plan
2. Automated token retrieval at payment time
3. Process payment through Paysafe API
4. Handle success/failure scenarios automatically
5. Update installment records and generate next payment
6. Notify customer of payment status

### Payment Method Management

**Updates and Changes**
- Customer initiates update through secure portal
- New payment details sent directly to Paysafe
- Old token deactivated, new token received
- Seamless transition for future payments

**Expiration Handling**
- Proactive monitoring 60-90 days before expiration
- Automated customer notifications
- Update workflow triggered before expiration
- Fallback payment methods if primary fails

## Data Storage Strategy

### What We Store Locally

**Payment Method References**
- Paysafe token (unique identifier)
- Payment method type (card/bank)
- Last 4 digits (for display only)
- Expiration date (for monitoring)
- Nickname (customer-defined)

**Verification Data**
- Verification status and date
- Verification method used
- Success/failure history
- Next verification date

**Transaction Records**
- Transaction identifiers
- Amount and date
- Success/failure status
- Paysafe reference numbers
- Related policy information

### What Paysafe Stores

**Sensitive Payment Data**
- Full credit card numbers
- Bank account numbers
- Routing numbers
- Security codes (CVV)
- Account holder details

**Payment Profiles**
- Complete payment method data
- Tokenization mappings
- Transaction history
- Risk assessment data

## Security and Compliance

### PCI DSS Scope Reduction

By not storing card data, our PCI compliance requirements are significantly reduced:
- No need for encrypted card storage
