# Updated Accounting Global Requirements Implementation Plan (Plan4)

## Executive Summary
This updated plan incorporates significant changes made to Global Requirements since plan3.md, particularly the addition of GR-64 (Policy Reinstatement), GR-10 (SR22/SR26 Filing), GR-37 (Action Tracking), and infrastructure patterns from the blitzy-requirements codebase. The plan emphasizes maximum integration with existing infrastructure while adding comprehensive accounting capabilities.

## 1. Key Changes Since Plan3

### 1.1 Major Global Requirements Additions
- **GR-64: Policy Reinstatement with Lapse Process** - Comprehensive premium recalculation, payment processing, and audit trail requirements
- **GR-10: SR22/SR26 Financial Responsibility Filing** - Fee structures, billing integration, and regulatory compliance
- **GR-37: Enhanced Action Tracking** - Centralized logging and audit requirements for all financial transactions
- **GR-41: Updated Table Schema Requirements** - Standardized patterns and reinstatement calculation schema

### 1.2 Infrastructure Integration Requirements
Based on analysis of `/app/workspace/blitzy-requirements/` codebase:

#### Existing Financial Models (Must Integrate With)
- **Payment.php** - Existing payment transaction model
- **Transaction.php** - Core financial transaction model  
- **PaymentMethod.php / PaymentMethodType.php** - Payment method infrastructure
- **MapPolicyTransaction.php** - Policy-transaction relationship mapping

#### Established Service Patterns (Must Follow)
- **EmailService** pattern for billing communications
- **AuthService** pattern for security integration
- **Laravel Eloquent ORM** with Sanctum authentication
- **RESTful API** patterns in `routes/api.php` and `routes/portal_api.php`

#### Universal Entity Management Integration (GR-52)
- **Paysafe Integration**: Use entity/entity_type pattern for payment gateway
- **Bank Integration**: Sunflower Bank using universal entity management
- **Communication Services**: SendGrid/Twilio integration (GR-44)
- **External Integrations**: Apache Camel routing patterns (GR-48)

### 1.3 Policy Reinstatement Financial Impact (GR-64)
Critical accounting implications requiring comprehensive integration:

#### Premium Calculation Requirements
- **Daily Rate Methodology**: `Daily Premium Rate = Total Policy Premium รท Total Policy Term Days`
- **Lapse Adjustment**: `Lapsed Premium = Daily Premium Rate ร Lapse Days`
- **Adjusted Premium**: `Adjusted Total Premium = Original Premium - Lapsed Premium`
- **Total Due Calculation**: Adjusted Premium + Unpaid Prior + Reinstatement Fees + Taxes

#### Payment Processing Integration
- **Eligibility Validation**: Real-time eligibility checking with 30-day window
- **Payment Triggered Reinstatement**: Reinstatement effective upon successful payment
- **Payment Schedule Restructuring**: Redistribute remaining balance across payment periods
- **Integration with Existing Payment Infrastructure**: Extend existing Payment/Transaction models

#### Audit and Compliance
- **Action Tracking Integration**: All reinstatement activities logged in action table (GR-37)
- **Calculation Audit Trail**: Store all calculation details in reinstatement_calculation table
- **Financial Transaction Logging**: Complete audit trail for all financial movements

### 1.4 SR22/SR26 Fee Processing (GR-10)
New billing and fee management requirements:

#### Fee Structure Requirements
- **SR22 Filing Fees**: State-specific fee schedules and billing cycles
- **SR26 Cancellation Fees**: Processing fees for SR22 cancellation
- **Recurring Billing**: Annual renewal fees and maintenance charges
- **Integration with Policy Billing**: SR22 fees included in policy premium calculations

#### Regulatory Compliance
- **State-Specific Requirements**: Different fee structures per state
- **Documentation Requirements**: Maintain comprehensive filing documentation
- **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of all SR22/SR26 fee transactions

## 2. Infrastructure Alignment Strategy

### 2.1 Database Schema Integration
**Extend Existing Infrastructure** (following GR-41 patterns):

#### Core Financial Tables (Extend Existing)
```sql
-- Extend existing transaction table with new types
ALTER TABLE transaction ADD COLUMN transaction_subtype VARCHAR(50) AFTER transaction_type;

-- New transaction types for accounting
INSERT INTO transaction_type (code, name, description) VALUES
('REINSTATEMENT', 'Reinstatement Premium', 'Policy reinstatement premium adjustment'),
('SR22_FEE', 'SR22 Filing Fee', 'SR22 financial responsibility filing fee'),
('SR26_FEE', 'SR26 Cancellation Fee', 'SR22 cancellation processing fee');
```

#### Reinstatement Integration (GR-64 Schema)
```sql
-- Reinstatement calculation table (from GR-64)
CREATE TABLE reinstatement_calculation (
    id BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    policy_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    cancellation_date DATE NOT NULL,
    reinstatement_date DATE NOT NULL,
    lapse_days INTEGER NOT NULL,
    original_premium DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    daily_premium_rate DECIMAL(8,4) NOT NULL,
    lapsed_premium DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    adjusted_premium DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    unpaid_premium DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0,
    reinstatement_fees DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0,
    total_due DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    status_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    created_by BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    updated_by BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    
    FOREIGN KEY (policy_id) REFERENCES policy(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (status_id) REFERENCES status(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (created_by) REFERENCES user(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (updated_by) REFERENCES user(id),
    
    INDEX idx_policy (policy_id),
    INDEX idx_reinstatement_date (reinstatement_date)
);
```

### 2.2 Service Layer Architecture
**Follow Established Patterns**:

#### AccountingService (Extend Existing Service Patterns)
```php
namespace App\Services\Accounting;

class AccountingService
{
    public function __construct(
        private PaymentService $paymentService,
        private EmailService $emailService, 
        private ReinstatementService $reinstatementService
    ) {}
    
    // Integrate with existing services rather than duplicate
}

class ReinstatementService 
{
    // Implement GR-64 requirements
    public function calculateReinstatementAmount(Policy $policy, Carbon $date): ReinstatementCalculation;
    public function processReinstatementPayment(Payment $payment): Policy;
}
```

### 2.3 API Integration Strategy
**Extend Existing Route Patterns**:

#### RESTful Accounting Endpoints
```php
// In routes/api.php (following existing patterns)
Route::prefix('accounting')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/transactions', [AccountingController::class, 'index']);
    Route::post('/reinstatement/calculate', [ReinstatementController::class, 'calculate']);
    Route::post('/reinstatement/process', [ReinstatementController::class, 'process']);
    Route::get('/sr22/fees', [SR22Controller::class, 'getFees']);
});
```
