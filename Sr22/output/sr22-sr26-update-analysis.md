# SR22/SR26 Global Requirement Creation - Update Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis for converting the SR22/SR26 process interpretation into a Global Requirement (GR-10). The analysis reveals that SR22 requirements are currently documented in multiple locations with varying levels of detail, creating an opportunity to establish a unified, program-agnostic Global Requirement that serves multiple insurance programs while maintaining consistency with existing business rules.

### Key Findings
- **GR-63 Enhanced Requirements**: Significantly expanded SR-22 requirements with detailed business rules
- **Process Documentation Gap**: Detailed workflows exist but are not integrated with business rules  
- **Cross-Reference Opportunities**: Multiple files reference SR22 concepts that would benefit from centralized requirements
- **Recommended Approach**: Create GR-10 as comprehensive SR22/SR26 Global Requirement

## Current State Analysis

### Existing SR22 Documentation Locations

#### 1. GR-63: Aguila Dorada Texas Personal Auto Program Traits
**Location**: `/app/workspace/requirements/GlobalRequirements/IndividualRequirements/63-aguila-dorada-program-traits.md`

**Current SR22 Content**:
- **Line 17**: Target market includes "SR-22 requirements"
- **Line 68**: Non-Owner coverage "Only for applicants requiring SR-22"
- **Line 81**: Coverage dependency "Non-Owner: Requires SR-22 need"
- **Line 105**: DWI conviction limit (related to SR-22 triggers)
- **Lines 118-121**: Basic SR-22 requirements section
- **Line 236**: SR22 Fee: $25.00 per driver requiring SR-22
- **Lines 391-399**: **ENHANCED SR-22 Filing Requirements** (newly added):
  - Policy Type Restriction: Eligible on semi-annual policies only
  - State Limitation: Cannot file SR-22's for any state other than Texas
  - Reason Documentation: Must include reason for filing
  - Source Documentation: Reason from DPS Suspension Letter
  - Filing Prerequisite: SR-22 filing will not be made unless reason included
  - Fee: $25.00 per driver
  - Processing: Filed with Texas Department of Public Safety

#### 2. SR22 Process Documentation
**Location**: `/app/workspace/requirements/Sr22/Documentation/SR22 Process.docx.md`

**Current Content**:
- Complete SR22 process workflows
- Form field requirements (14 specific fields)
- Business rules for processing
- SR26 cancellation process
- System integration requirements
- State reporting specifications

#### 3. SR22/SR26 Process Interpretation
**Location**: `/app/workspace/requirements/Sr22/output/sr22-sr26-process-interpretation.md`

**Current Content**:
- Comprehensive interpretation combining both sources
- 9 detailed sections covering all aspects

#### 4. Related References
**Location**: `/app/workspace/requirements/GlobalRequirements/IndividualRequirements/48-external-integrations-catalog.md`
- **Line 252**: TexasSure Integration for "Texas insurance verification"

### Current Reference Pattern Analysis

**Pattern**: SR22 requirements are currently embedded within program-specific documentation (GR-63) rather than existing as a standalone Global Requirement that can be referenced by multiple programs.

**Impact**: This creates program-specific constraints and limits reusability across different insurance programs that may also require SR22/SR26 capabilities.

## Gap Analysis: Original Process vs. Enhanced GR-63

### Original SR22 Process Documentation Strengths
- **Comprehensive Workflows**: Detailed step-by-step processes
- **Form Specifications**: Complete field requirements
- **System Integration**: Clear automation requirements
- **State Reporting**: Weekly submission specifications

### Enhanced GR-63 Requirements Strengths
- **Business Rules**: Specific eligibility constraints
- **Policy Restrictions**: Semi-annual policy limitation
- **Documentation Requirements**: DPS Suspension Letter requirement
- **State Limitations**: Texas-only filing restriction
- **Compliance Framework**: Regulatory alignment

### Integration Opportunities
1. **Process + Rules**: Combine detailed workflows with enhanced business rules
2. **System + Compliance**: Integrate system requirements with regulatory framework
3. **Generalization**: Create program-agnostic version that can serve multiple programs
4. **Cross-Reference**: Establish proper Global Requirement reference structure
