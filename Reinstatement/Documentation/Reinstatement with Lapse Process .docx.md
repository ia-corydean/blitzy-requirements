Policies canceled for **nonpayment** may be **reinstated within 30 days** of the cancellation date. If cancellation exceeds 30 days, the policy must be **rewritten**. A **lapse in coverage** applies—**no coverage and no premium earned during lapse period**.

---

**System Workflow**

1. **Cancellation Handling**

   * Upon cancellation, the system suspends coverage and billing.

   * Premium accrual stops.

   * Policy is marked as Cancelled but is eligible for reinstatement if within 30 days.

2. **Reinstatement Trigger**

   * Reinstatement is initiated upon **successful payment**.

   * System captures the **payment date and time** → this becomes the **reinstatement effective date**.

   * **No backdating** of coverage is allowed during the lapse period.

3. **Premium Recalculation**

   * System recalculates the **remaining premium**:

     * **Daily Premium Rate** \= Total Premium / Total Term Days

     * **Remaining Days** \= Days from Reinstatement Date to Policy Expiration

     * **Remaining Premium Due** \= Daily Premium × Remaining Days

   * Any **unpaid premium** prior to cancellation is added.

   * **Applicable fees** (e.g., reinstatement fee, installment fee) are added.

4. **Installment Adjustment**

   * The system determines the **number of remaining installments**.

   * The remaining premium is divided **equally** among them.

   * If reinstatement occurs within **10 days of the next due date**, the first payment is **deducted** from the remaining balance and becomes due immediately.

   * If **only one installment remains**, and reinstatement is within 10 days of that due date → **entire balance** is due upfront.

**Example**

**Total Premium:** $600

**Policy Term:** 180 days

**Canceled After:** 90 days

**Reinstated on Day 105 (15-day lapse)**

**Unpaid Premium prior to cancellation:** $100

**Installments left:** 3

**Fees:** $25 reinstatement fee

**Payments previously made:** $200

**Daily Premium \= 600 / 180 \= $3.33**

Lapsed unearned premium: 15 × $3.33 \= $49.95

New Total Premium \= $600 \- $49.95 \= $550.05

Add unpaid premium: $100

Add reinstatement fee: $25

Total Owed: $550.05 \+ $100 \+ $25 \= $675.05

Subtract funds collected: $200

**Policy Balance \= $475.05**

Divide by 3 installments → **$158.35 each** (adjust if within 10 days of next due)
