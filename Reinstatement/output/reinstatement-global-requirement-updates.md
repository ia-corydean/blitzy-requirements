1. **Add Reinstatement Considerations to SR22 Processing**:
   ```markdown
   ### Policy Reinstatement Impact on SR22 Status
   - **Reinstatement Continuation**: Active SR22 filings continue through policy reinstatement
   - **No New Filing Required**: Policy reinstatement does not trigger new SR22 filing
   - **Status Maintenance**: SR22 status maintained during lapse period
   - **State Notification**: No state notification required for reinstatement of policies with active SR22
   ```

2. **Update Cross-Reference Section**:
   ```markdown
   ### Related Global Requirements
   - **GR-64**: Policy Reinstatement with Lapse Process - SR22 considerations during reinstatement
   ```

3. **Add Business Rule for Reinstatement**:
   - SR22 requirements remain in effect during policy lapse periods
   - Reinstatement does not affect existing SR22 filing status
   - Premium calculations for reinstated policies include SR22 fees if applicable

**Rationale**: Since SR22 is a legal requirement that exists independently of policy status, reinstatement should not affect SR22 filing status. The SR22 remains active even during policy lapse periods.

   - **Used By**: Reinstatement workflow, audit trails
   - **Relationships**: Belongs to policy
   - **Requirements**: GR-64 Policy Reinstatement
   ```

2. **Update Existing Entity Relationships**:
   - Update policy entity to include reinstatement status tracking
   - Add reinstatement-related status values
   - Update payment entity relationships for reinstatement payments
